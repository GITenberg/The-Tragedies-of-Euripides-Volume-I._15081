<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

  <p>The translations of the first six plays in the present volume were
  published at Oxford some years since, and have been frequently reprinted.
  They are now carefully revised according to Dindorf's text, and are
  accompanied by a few additional notes adapted to the requirements of the
  student.</p>

  <p>The translations of the Bacchæ, Heraclidæ, and the two Iphigenias, are
  based upon the same text, with certain exceptions, which are pointed out
  at the foot of the page. The annotations on the Iphigenias are almost
  exclusively critical, as it is presumed that a student who proceeds to
  the reading of these somewhat difficult plays<a name="NtA_1"></a><a
  href="#Nt_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>, will be sufficiently advanced in his
  acquaintance with the Greek drama to dispense with more elementary
  information.</p>

<a name="INTRODUCTION"></a>
<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Euripides, son of Mnesarchus, was born in the island of Salamis, on
  the day of the celebrated victory (B.C. 480). His mother, Clito, had been
  sent thither in company with the other Athenian women, when Attica was
  given up, and the ships became at once the refuge of the male population,
  and the national defense. Mr. Donaldson<a name="Int_1"></a><a
  href="#IntN_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> well remarks, that the patronymic form
  of his name, derived from the Euripus, which was the scene of the first
  successful resistance offered to the Persian navy, shows that the
  attention of his parents was fully excited by the stirring events of the
  time.</p>

  <p>Notwithstanding the fact that his mother had been an herb-seller, it
  is probable that his father was a man of some family. That he was at
  least possessed of ample means, is evident from the care and expense
  bestowed upon our poet's education. Under the tutorship of Anaxagoras,
  Prodicus, and Protagoras, he had studied both natural philosophy and
  rhetoric in its sophistical form. In gymnastic exercises he exhibited a
  successful prowess, being twice victorious in the Eleusinian and Thesean
  games. Of his skill in painting, some specimens were preserved at
  Megara.</p>

  <p>His appearance as a dramatist was at an earlier age than that of his
  predecessors, as he was only five and twenty years old when he produced
  the "Peliades," his first tragedy. On this occasion, he gained the third
  prize in the tragic contests, but the first, fourteen years after, and
  subsequently, with the "Hippolytus," in 428 B.C. The peculiar tendency of
  some of the ideas expressed in his plays, was the probable cause of the
  retirement of Euripides to Macedonia, where he obtained the friendship of
  King Archelaus. Perhaps, however, the unhappiness of his connubial state,
  arising from the infidelity of his two wives, might have rendered Athens
  a disagreeable place of abode for the woman-hating poet, especially when
  his "domestic bliss" was continually seasoned by the sarcastic jokes and
  allusions of his political enemy, Aristophanes. Moreover, his
  acquaintance with the talking philosopher, Socrates, must have been
  unfavorable to the continuance of his popularity.</p>

  <p>The fate of Pentheus in our author's noble play, the "Bacchæ," appears
  to have given origin to the tradition that he himself was torn to pieces
  by dogs. If we reflect that this play was probably the last of his works,
  the mistake seems a plausible one. The death of Euripides, which probably
  happened in the ordinary course of nature, has, like that of Æschylus,
  been associated with the marvelous.</p>

  <p>The Athenians vainly craved the honor of giving a resting-place to the
  ashes of their philosopher-poet. He was buried at Pella, but a cenotaph
  at Athens showed that his countrymen had not forgotten Euripides. His
  death took place B.C. 406.</p>

  <p>The inferiority of our author to the greater tragedians, prevents our
  feeling much desire to enter upon the respective merits and demerits of
  his several plays, especially as we are completely anticipated by
  Schlegel, with whose masterly analysis every reader ought to be
  acquainted. Nevertheless, a few general remarks may, perhaps, be not
  wholly unprofitable.</p>

  <p>It has been truly remarked, that tragedy, in no small degree, owed its
  downfall to Euripides. Poetry was gradually superseded by rhetoric,
  sublimity by earnestness, pathos by reasoning. Thus, Iphigenia and
  Macaria give so many good reasons for dying, that the sacrifice appears
  very small, and a modern wag in the upper regions of the theatre would,
  at the end of the speech of the latter heroine, almost have exclaimed,
  "Then why don't you die?"</p>

  <p>It has been said, that our poet drew the characters of life as he
  found them, but bad as his characters are, they exhibit only a vulgar
  wickedness. Unable to portray a Clytæmnestra, he revels in the continual
  paltriness of a Menelaus or Ulysses. As if he took a delight in the black
  side of humanity, he loves to show the strength of false reasoning, of
  sophistry antagonistic to truth, and of cold expediency in opposition to
  the natural feelings of humanity. From a similar reason, his occasional
  attempts at comedy degenerate into mere farce. We question whether the
  scene between Death and Apollo in the "Alcestis," could be surpassed in
  vulgarity, even by the modern school of English dramatists, while his
  exaggerations in the minor characters are scarcely to be surpassed by the
  lowest writer of any period.</p>

  <p>Under Euripides, the stage began gradually to approximate more closely
  to the ordinary and, at that time, debased character of Athenian society.
  A contempt for the Lacedæmonians, a passionate taste for the babbling and
  trickery of the forum, and an attempt to depreciate the social position
  and influence of the weaker sex, form the most unamiable features of this
  change. Yet we must allow, that if Euripides has reveled in the
  amiabilities of a Melanippe or a Phædra, in the gentle revenge of a Medea
  or Hecuba, he has at the same time given us an Alcestis, the only real
  example of genuine conjugal affection on the Greek stage.</p>

  <p>Nor must we forget that Euripides is a greater admirer of nature, a
  more complete delineator of her workings, than the two greater
  tragedians. He has more of illustrative philosophy, more of regard to the
  objects of the animated creation, the system of the universe, than his
  greater rivals exhibit. He is, as Vitruvius has justly styled him, a
  "stage-philosopher." Did we possess a larger acquaintance with the works
  of Parmenides, Empedocles, and other early cosmogonists, we should
  perhaps think less of his merits on this head: as it is, the possession
  of some such fragments of our poet makes us deeply regret the loss of the
  plays themselves.</p>

  <p>But his very love for the contemplation of nature has in no small
  degree contributed to the mischievous skepticism promulgated by our poet.
  In early times, when a rural theogony was the standard of belief, when
  each star had its deity, each deity its undisputed, unquestioned
  prerogative and worship, there was little inclination, less opportunity,
  for skepticism. Throughout the poetry of Hesiod, we find this feeling
  ever predominant, a feeling which Virgil and Tibullus well knew how to
  appreciate. Even Euripides himself, perhaps taught by some dangerous
  lessons at home, has expressed his belief that it is best "not to be too
  clever in matters regarding the Gods."<a name="Int_2"></a><a
  href="#IntN_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> A calm retreat in the wild, picturesque
  tracts of Macedonia, might have had some share in reforming this spoiled
  pupil of the sophists. But as we find that the too careful contemplation
  of nature degenerates into superstition or rationalism in their various
  forms, so Euripides had imbibed the taste for saying startling things,<a
  name="Int_3"></a><a href="#IntN_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> rather than wise;
  for reducing the principles of creation to materialism, the doctrines of
  right and wrong to expediency, and immutable truths to a popular system
  of question and answer. Like the generality of sophists, he took away a
  received truth, and left nothing to supply its place; he reasoned
  falsehood into probability, truth into nonentity.</p>

  <p>At a period when the Prodico-Socratic style of disputing was in high
  fashion, the popularity of Euripides must have been excessive. His
  familiar appeals to the trifling matters of ordinary life, his characters
  all philosophizing, from the prince to the dry-nurse, his excellent
  reasons for doing right or wrong, as the case might be, must have been
  inestimably delightful to the accommodating morals of the Athenians. The
  Court of Charles the Second could hardly have derived more pleasure from
  the writings of a Behn or a Hamilton, than these unworthy descendants of
  Codrus must have experienced in hearing a bad cause so cleverly defended.
  Whether the orators and dikasts followed the example of the stage in
  those days, can scarcely be ascertained, but it is more than certain that
  they practically illustrated its principles. At least, the Sicilians were
  so fond of our author, that a few of the unfortunate survivors of the
  Syracusan disaster, were enabled to pick up a living by quoting such
  passages of our author as they had learned by heart. A compliment paid to
  few living dramatists in our days!</p>

  <p>In dramatic conduct, Euripides is at an even greater disadvantage with
  Æschylus and Sophocles. The best characters of the piece are often the
  least employed, as in the instance of Macaria in the "Heraclidæ," while
  the play is dwindled away with dull, heavy dirges, and the complaints of
  senile childishness. The chorus, as Aristotle<a name="Int_4"></a><a
  href="#IntN_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> has remarked, is most unfortunately
  independent of the plot, although the finest poetry is generally to be
  found in the lyric portions of our author's plays. In fact, Euripides
  rather wanted management in employing his resources, than the resources
  themselves. An ear well attuned to the harmony of verse, a delicate
  perception of the graceful points of language, and a finished subtilty in
  touching the more minute feelings and impulses of the mind, were all
  thrown away either upon bad subjects or worse principles. There is no
  true tragedy in Euripides, He is a melodramatist, but not according to
  the modern acceptation. His plays might end either happily or the
  reverse. A deity conveniently brought in, the arrival of a messenger,
  however unexpectedly, together with a liberal allowance for a cowardly
  revenge upon the vanquished&mdash;these are the Euripidean elements for
  giving a tragic end to a play. Nay, so great is the prodigality of
  slaughter throughout his dramas, that we can but imagine morbid cruelty
  to have formed a considerable ingredient in the disposition of Euripides.
  Even his pathos is somewhat tinctured with this taste for painful images.
  As we have beheld in our own times a barbarian alternately glut his sight
  with executions, and then shed floods of tears, and sink into idiot
  despondency; so the poetry of Euripides in turn disgusts us with
  outrageous cruelty, and depresses us with the most painful demands upon
  our compassion.</p>

  <p>In the lyric portions of his dramas, our poet has been far more
  successful. The description of the capture of Troy by night,<a
  name="Int_5"></a><a href="#IntN_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> is a splendid
  specimen of animation blended with true pathos. But taken as a whole.
  Euripides is a most unequal author. We may commence a play with pleasure
  (but O for the prologues!), we may proceed with satisfaction, but the
  feeling rarely lasts to the end. If I may venture an opinion upon so
  uncertain a subject, I should name the Hippolytus, Ion, Troades, Bacchæ,
  and Iphigenia in Aulis as his best plays, placing the Ph&#339;nissæ,
  Alcestis, Medea, Hecuba, and Orestes in a lower rank. The Helena is an
  amusing heap of absurdities, and reads much better in the burlesque of
  Aristophanes; the Electra is utterly beneath criticism; the Cyclops a
  weak, but humorous imitation of Homer. The other plays appear to be
  neither bad nor good.</p>

  <p>The style of Euripides is, generally speaking, easy; and I can mention
  no author from whom a taste for elegant Greek and a facility in
  composition can more easily be derived. Some of his plays have suffered
  severely from the ravages of time, the ignorance of copyists, and the
  more dangerous officiousness of grammarians. Some passages of the Bacchæ,
  Rhesus, Troades, and the two Iphigenias, despite the ingenuity and
  erudition of such scholars as Porson, Elmsley, Monk, Burges, and a host
  of others, must still remain mere matter for guessing. Hermann's
  Euripides is, as a whole, sadly unworthy the abilities of the Humboldt of
  Greek literature.</p>

  <p>The present volume contains the most popular of our author's works,
  according to present usage. But the spirit which is gradually infusing
  itself into the minds of those who are most actively engaged in the
  educational system of England, fully warrants a hope that Porson's "four
  plays" will shortly cease to be the boundaries of the student's
  acquaintance with Euripides.</p>

  <p>I need scarcely observe, that the study of Aristophanes is
  indissolubly connected with that of our author. If the reader discover
  the painful fact that the burlesque writer is greater than the tragedian,
  he will perhaps also recollect that such a literary relation is,
  unfortunately, by no means confined to the days of Aristophanes.</p>

<h3>THE ARGUMENT.</h3>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>After the capture of Troy, the Greeks put into the Chersonese over
  against Troas, But Achilles, having appeared by night, demanded one of
  the daughters of Priam to be slain. The Greeks therefore, in honor to
  their hero, tore Polyxena from Hecuba, and offered her up in sacrifice.
  Polymestor moreover, the king of the Thracians, murdered Polydore, a son
  of Priam's. Now Polymestor had received him from the hands of Priam as a
  charge to take care of, together with some money. But when the city was
  taken, wishing to seize upon his wealth, he determined to dispatch him,
  and disregarded the ill-fated friendship that subsisted between them; but
  his body being cast out into the sea, the wave threw him up on the shore
  before the tents of the captive women. Hecuba, on seeing the corse,
  recognized it; and having imparted her design to Agamemnon, sent for
  Polymestor to come to her with his sons, concealing what had happened,
  under pretense that she might discover to him some treasures hidden in
  Ilium. But on his arrival she slew his sons, and put out his eyes; but
  pleading her cause before the Greeks, she gained it over her accuser
  (Polymestor). For it was decided that she did not begin the cruelty, but
  only avenged herself on him who did begin it.</p>

<hr />

<h2>HECUBA.</h2>

<hr class="short" />

<p class="center">GHOST OF POLYDORE.</p>

  <p>I am present, having left the secret dwellings of the dead and the
  gates of darkness, where Pluto has his abode apart from the other Gods,
  Polydore the son of Hecuba the daughter of Cisseus,<a name="Hec_1"></a><a
  href="#HecN_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> and Priam my sire, who when the danger
  of falling by the spear of Greece was threatening the city of the
  Phrygians, in fear, privately sent me from the Trojan land to the house
  of Polymestor, his Thracian friend, who cultivates the most fruitful soil
  of the Chersonese, ruling a warlike people with his spear.<a
  name="Hec_2"></a><a href="#HecN_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> But my father sends
  privately with me a large quantity of gold, in order that, if at any time
  the walls of Troy should fall, there might not be a lack of sustenance
  for his surviving children. But I was the youngest of the sons of Priam;
  on which account also he sent me privately from the land, for I was able
  neither to bear arms nor the spear with my youthful arm. As long then
  indeed as the landmarks of the country remained erect, and the towers of
  Troy were unshaken, and Hector my brother prevailed with his spear, I
  miserable increased vigorously as some young branch, by the nurture I
  received at the hands of the Thracian, my father's friend. But after that
  both Troy and the life of Hector were put an end to, and my father's
  mansions razed to the ground, and himself falls at the altar built by the
  God, slain by the blood-polluted son of Achilles, the friend of my father
  slays me, wretched man, for the sake of my gold, and having slain me
  threw me into the surf of the sea, that he might possess the gold himself
  in his palace. But I am exposed on the shore, at another time on the
  ocean's surge, borne about by many ebbings and flowings of the waves,
  unwept, unburied; but at present I am hastening on my dear mother's
  account, having left my body, borne aloft this day already the third,<a
  name="Hec_3"></a><a href="#HecN_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> for so long has my
  wretched mother been present in this territory of the Chersonese from
  Troy. But all the Grecians, holding their ships at anchor, are sitting
  quiet on the shores of this land of Thrace. For Achilles the son of
  Peleus, appearing above his tomb, stayed all the army of the Grecians as
  they were directing homeward their sea dipped oars; and asks to receive
  my sister Polyxena as a dear victim, and a tribute of honor to his tomb.
  And this he will obtain, nor will he be without this gift from his
  friends; and fate this day leads forth my sister to death. But my mother
  will see the two corses of her two children, both mine and the unhappy
  virgin's; for I shall appear on a breaker before the feet of a female
  slave, that I wretched may obtain sepulture; for I have successfully
  entreated those who have power beneath to find a tomb, and to fall into
  my mother's hands. As much then as I wish to have shall be mine; but I
  will withdraw myself out of the way of the aged Hecuba, for she is
  advancing her step beyond the tent of Agamemnon, dreading my phantom.
  Alas! O my mother, who, from kingly palaces, hast beheld the day of
  slavery, how unfortunate art thou now, in the degree that thou wert once
  fortunate! but some one of the Gods counterpoising your state, destroys
  you on account of your ancient prosperity.</p>

<p class="center">HECUBA. CHORUS.</p>

  <p>HEC. Lead onward, ye Trojan dames, the old woman before the tent; lead
  onward, raising up one now your fellow-slave, but once your queen; take
  me, bear me, conduct me, support my body, holding my aged hand; and I,
  leaning on the bending staff of my hand,<a name="Hec_4"></a><a
  href="#HecN_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> will hasten to put forward the slow
  motion of my joints. O lightning of Jove! O thou gloomy night! why, I
  pray, am I thus disquieted in the night with terrors, with phantoms? O
  thou venerable Earth, the mother of black-winged dreams, I renounce the
  nightly vision, which regarding my son who is preserved in Thrace, and
  regarding Polyxena my dear daughter, in my dreams have I beheld, a
  fearful sight, I have learned, I have understood. Gods of this land,
  preserve my son, who, my only son, and, [as it were,] the anchor of my
  house, inhabits the snowy Thrace under the protection of his father's
  friend. Some strange event will take place, some strain will come
  mournful to the mournful. Never did my mind so incessantly shudder and
  tremble. Where, I pray, ye Trojan dames, can I behold the divine spirit
  of Helenus, or Cassandra, that they may interpret my dreams? For I beheld
  a dappled hind torn by the blood-stained fang of the wolf, forcibly
  dragged from my bosom, a miserable sight. And dreadful this vision also;
  the spectre of Achilles came above the summit of his tomb, and demanded
  as a tribute of honor one of the wretched Trojan women. From my daughter
  then, from my daughter avert this fate, ye Gods, I implore you.</p>

  <p>CHOR. Hecuba, with haste to thee I flew, leaving the tents of our
  lords, where I was allotted and ordained a slave, driven from the city of
  Troy, led captive of the Greeks by the point of the spear, not to
  alleviate aught of your sufferings, but bringing a heavy weight of
  tidings, and to thee, O lady, a herald of woe. For it is said that it has
  been decreed in the full council of the Greeks to make thy daughter a
  sacrifice to Achilles: for you know how that having ascended o'er his
  tomb, he appeared in his golden arms and restrained the fleet ships, as
  they were setting their sails with their halliards, exclaiming in these
  words; "Where speed ye, Grecians, leaving my tomb unhonored!" Then the
  waves of great contention clashed together, and a divided opinion went
  forth through the army of the Greeks; to some it appeared advisable to
  give a victim to his tomb, and to others it appeared not. But Agamemnon
  was studious to advance your good, cherishing the love of the infuriated
  prophetess. But the two sons of Theseus, scions of Athens, were the
  proposers of different arguments, but in this one opinion they coincided,
  to crown the tomb of Achilles with fresh blood; and declared they would
  never prefer the bed of Cassandra before the spear of Achilles. And the
  strength of the arguments urged on either side was in a manner equal,
  till that subtle adviser, that babbling knave,<a name="Hec_5"></a><a
  href="#HecN_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> honeyed in speech, pleasing to the
  populace, that son of Laertes, persuades the army, not to reject the suit
  of the noblest of all the Greeks on account of a captive victim, and not
  to put it in the power of any of the dead standing near Proserpine to say
  that the Grecians departed from the plains of Troy ungrateful to the
  heroes who died for the state of Greece. And Ulysses will come only not
  now, to tear your child from your bosom, and to take her from your aged
  arms. But go to the temples, speed to the altars, sit a suppliant at the
  knees of Agamemnon, invoke the Gods, both those of heaven, and those
  under the earth; for either thy prayers will prevent thy being deprived
  of thy wretched daughter, or thou must behold the virgin falling before
  the tomb, dyed in blood gushing forth in a dark stream from her neck
  adorned with gold.<a name="Hec_6"></a><a
  href="#HecN_6"><sup>[6]</sup></a></p>

  <p>HEC. Alas! wretched me! what shall I exclaim? what shriek shall I
  utter? what lamentation? miserable through miserable age, and slavery not
  to be endured, insupportable. Alas! who is there to defend me? what
  offspring, what city! The old man is gone. My children are gone. Whither
  shall I turn me? and whither shall I go? Where is any god or deity to
  succor me? O Trojan dames, bearers of evil tidings, bearers of woe, you
  have destroyed me utterly, you have destroyed me. Life in the light is no
  more desirable! O wretched foot, lead, lead an aged woman to this tent! O
  child, daughter of the most afflicted mother, come forth, come forth from
  the tent, hear thy mother's voice, that thou mayest know what a report I
  hear that concerns thy life.</p>

<p class="center">HECUBA, POLYXENA, CHORUS.</p>

  <p>POLYX. O mother, why dost thou call! proclaiming what new affliction
  hast thou frighted me from the tent, as some bird from its nest, with
  this alarm?</p>

  <p>HEC. Alas! my child!</p>

  <p>POLYX. Why address me in words of ill omen? This is an evil
  prelude.</p>

  <p>HEC. Alas! for thy life.</p>

  <p>POLYX. Speak, conceal it no longer from me. I fear, I fear, my mother;
  why I pray dost thou groan?</p>

  <p>HEC. O child, child of an unhappy mother!</p>

  <p>POLYX. Why sayest thou this?</p>

  <p>HEC. My child, the common decree of the Greeks unites to slay thee at
  the tomb of the son of Peleus.</p>

  <p>POLYX. Alas, my mother! how are you relating unenviable ills? Tell me,
  tell me, my mother.</p>

  <p>HEC. I declare, my child, the ill-omened report, they bring word that
  a decree has passed by the vote of the Greeks regarding thy life.</p>

  <p>POLYX. O thou that hast borne affliction! O thou wretched on every
  side! O mother unhappy in your life, what most hated and most unutterable
  calamity has some destiny again sent against thee! This child is no
  longer thine; no longer indeed shall I miserable share slavery with
  miserable age. For as a mountain whelp or heifer shalt thou wretched
  behold me wretched torn from thine arms, and sent down beneath the
  darkness of the earth a victim to Pluto, where I shall lie bound in
  misery with the dead. But it is for thee indeed, my afflicted mother,
  that I lament in these mournful strains, but for my life, my wrongs, my
  fate, I mourn not; but death, a better lot, has befallen me.</p>

  <p>CHOR. But see Ulysses advances with hasty step, to declare to thee,
  Hecuba, some new determination.</p>

<p class="center">ULYSSES, HECUBA, POLYXENA, CHORUS.</p>

  <p>ULYSS. Lady, I imagine that you are acquainted with the decree of the
  army, and the vote which has prevailed; nevertheless, I will declare it.
  It has been decreed by the Greeks to offer on the lofty mound of
  Achilles's tomb thy daughter Polyxena. But they order me to conduct and
  convey the damsel; but the son of Achilles is appointed to be the priest,
  and to preside over the rites. Do you know then what to do? Be not
  dragged away by violence, nor enter into a contest of strength with me,
  but acknowledge superior force and the presence of thy ills; it is wise
  to have proper sentiments even in adversity.</p>

  <p>HEC. Alas! alas! the great trial is at hand, as it seems, of
  lamentations full, nor without tears; for I have not died in the state in
  which I ought to have died, nor hath Jove destroyed me, but preserves me,
  that I wretched may behold other misfortunes greater than [past]
  misfortunes. But if it be allowed slaves to put questions to the free,
  not offensive nor grating to the feelings, it will be your part to be
  questioned, and ours who are asking to attend.</p>

  <p>ULYSS. You have permission, ask freely, I grudge not the time.</p>

  <p>HEC. Dost thou remember when thou camest a spy on Troy, disfigured by
  a vile dress, and from thine eyes drops caused by the fear of death
  bedewed thy beard?</p>

  <p>ULYSS. I remember well; for it made no slight impression on my
  heart.</p>

  <p>HEC. But Helen knew thee, and told me alone.</p>

  <p>ULYSS. I remember the great danger I encountered.</p>

  <p>HEC. And didst thou embrace my knees in thy humility?</p>

  <p>ULYSS. So that my hand was numbered<a name="Hec_7"></a><a
  href="#HecN_7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> through fear on thy garments.</p>

  <p>HEC. What then didst thou say, being then my slave?</p>

  <p>ULYSS. Many arguments that I invented to save me from death.</p>

  <p>HEC. Did I preserve thee then, and conduct thee safe from the
  land?</p>

  <p>ULYSS. Yes, so that I now behold the light of the sun.</p>

  <p>HEC. Art thou not then convicted of baseness by this conduct, who hast
  received benefits from me such as thou acknowledgest thou hast, and doest
  us no good in return, but evil, as far as in thee lies? Thankless is your
  race, as many of you as court honor from oratory before the populace; be
  ye not known to me, who care not to injure your friends, provided you say
  what is gratifying to the people. But plotting what dark design have they
  determined upon a decree of death against my child? Did fate impel them
  to offer human sacrifices at the tomb, where it were rather right to
  sacrifice cattle? Or does Achilles, desirous of devoting in his turn to
  death those that wrought his death, with a color of justice meditate her
  destruction? But she has done him no ill: he should demand Helen as a
  sacrifice on his tomb; for she destroyed him, and brought him to Troy.
  But if some captive selected from the rest, and excelling in beauty,
  ought to die, this is not ours. For the daughter of Tyndarus is most
  preeminent in beauty, and has been found to be no less injurious than us.
  On the score of justice then I urge this argument; but with respect to
  what you ought to repay at my demand, hear: thou hast touched my hand, as
  thou ownest, and this aged cheek also, falling at my knees. Thy hand and
  knees I in return grasp, and re-demand the favor I granted you then, and
  beseech you, do not tear my child from my arms, nor kill her; enough have
  died already. In her I rejoice, and forget my misfortunes; she serves as
  my consolation in the stead of many things, she is my city, my nurse, my
  staff, the guide of my way. It becomes not those who have power to
  exercise their power in things wherein they ought not, nor should the
  fortunate imagine their fortune will last forever. For I too have had my
  time of prosperity, but now have I ceased to be: one day wrenched from me
  all my happiness. But by thy beard which I supplicate, reverence me, pity
  me; go to the Grecian army, and remind them that it is a shameful thing
  to slay women whom ye have once spared, and that too dragging them from
  the altar. But show mercy. But the laws of blood among you are laid down
  alike for the free and the slave. But your worth will carry with it
  persuasion, although your arguments be bad; for the same words from those
  of little character, have not the same force as when they proceed from
  those of high reputation.</p>

  <p>CHOR. There is no nature of man so obdurate, which on hearing thy
  groans, and thy long plaints of misery, would not let fall the tear.</p>

  <p>ULYSS. Hecuba, be advised, nor through passion deem him thine enemy
  who gives thee good advice. I indeed am ready to preserve thy person
  through the means of which I was fortunate; and I say no other. But what
  I declared before all I will not deny, that, Troy being captured, we
  should give thy daughter as a victim to the noblest man of the army, who
  demands her; for in this many cities fail, when any man who is brave and
  zealous receives no more honor than those who are less valiant. But
  Achilles, O lady, is worthy of honor from us, a man who died most
  gloriously in behalf of the Grecian country. Were not then this
  disgraceful, if when living we treat him as a friend, but after he is
  gone we no longer treat him so? Well! what then will any one say, if
  there again should be an assembling of the army, and a contest with the
  enemy: "Shall we fight or preserve our lives, seeing that he who falls
  lies unhonored?" But for me at least, living from day to day, although I
  have but little, that little is sufficient; but I would wish that my
  monument should be beheld crowned with honor, for the gratification is
  for a long time. But if thou sayest thou sufferest affliction, hear this
  in return from me. There are with us aged matrons, and hoary sires, not
  less wretched than thou art, and brides bereft of the noblest husbands,
  whose ashes this land of Troy conceals. Endure this. But we, if we
  injudiciously determine to honor the brave man, shall incur the charge of
  folly. But you barbarians neither consider your friends as friends, nor
  do you hold up to admiration those who have died honorably; thus shall
  Greece be prosperous, but you shall experience fortune corresponding to
  your counsels.</p>

  <p>CHOR. Alas! alas! how wretched is the state of slavery, and to endure
  indignities compelled by superior force! (Note <a name="Hec_B"></a><a
  href="#HecN_B">[B]</a>.)</p>

  <p>HEC. O daughter, my words respecting thy death are vanished in the
  air, set forth in vain; but thou, if thou hast greater powers [of
  persuasion] than thy mother, use all thy influence, uttering every note
  as the throat of the nightingale, that thou mayest not be deprived of
  life. But fall before the knees of Ulysses in all the eloquence of grief,
  and persuade him; thou hast a pretext, for he also hath children; so that
  he may be inclined to pity thy fortune.</p>

  <p>POLYX. I see, Ulysses, that thou art hiding thy hand beneath thy robe,
  and turnest thy face away, that I may not touch thy beard. Be not afraid;
  thou hast avoided my suppliant Jove; for I will follow thee both on
  account of fate, and even wishing to die; but if I were not willing, I
  should appear base, and too fond of life. For wherefore should I live,
  whose father was monarch of all the Trojans; this my dawn of life. Then
  was I nurtured under fair hope, a bride for princes, having no small
  competition for my hand, to whose palace and hearth I should come. But I,
  wretched now, was mistress among the Trojan women, and conspicuous in the
  train of virgins, equal to goddesses, death only excepted. But now I am a
  slave; first of all the very name, not being familiar, persuades me to
  love death. Then perhaps I might meet with masters cruel in disposition,
  who will buy me for silver, the sister both of Hector and many other
  [heroes.] And imposing the task of making bread in his palace, will
  compel me, passing the day in misery, both to sweep the house, and stand
  at the loom. And some slave somewhere purchased will defile my bed,
  before wooed by princes. This never shall be. I will quit this light from
  mine eyes free, offering my body to Pluto. Lead on then, Ulysses, conduct
  me to death; for I see neither confidence of hope, nor of expectation,
  present to me that I can ever enjoy good fortune. But do thou, my mother,
  in no wise hinder me by your words or by your actions; but assent to my
  death before I meet with indignities unsuited to my rank. For one who has
  not been accustomed to taste misfortunes bears indeed, but grieves, to
  put his neck under the yoke. But he would be far more blessed in death
  than in life; for to live otherwise than honorably is a great burden.</p>

  <p>CHOR. It is a great and distinguishing feature among men to be born of
  generous parents, and the name of nobility of birth among the
  illustrious, proceeds from great to greater still.</p>

  <p>HEC. You have spoken honorably, my daughter, but in that honorable
  dwells grief. But if the son of Peleus must be gratified, and you must
  escape blame, Ulysses, kill not her; but leading me to the pyre of
  Achilles, strike me, spare me not; I brought forth Paris, who destroyed
  the son of Thetis, having pierced him with his arrows.</p>

  <p>ULYSS. The phantom of Achilles did not demand that thou, O aged lady,
  but that thy daughter here should die.</p>

  <p>HEC. Do thou then at least slay me with my daughter, and there will be
  twice the libation of blood for the earth, and the dead who makes this
  request.</p>

  <p>ULYSS. Thy daughter's death suffices; one must not be heaped on
  another; would that we required not even this one.</p>

  <p>HEC. There is a strong necessity for me to die with my daughter.</p>

  <p>ULYSS. How so? for I am not aware of any master that I have.</p>

  <p>HEC. As the ivy the oak, so will I clasp her.</p>

  <p>ULYSS. Not so; if you will take the advice of your superiors in
  knowledge.</p>

  <p>HEC. Never will I willingly quit my child here.</p>

  <p>ULYSS. Nor will I leave this place without the virgin.</p>

  <p>POLYX. Mother, be persuaded; and thou, son of Laertes, be gentle to a
  parent with reason moved to anger. But thou, O wretched mother, contend
  not with conquerors. Dost thou wish to fall on the earth and to wound thy
  aged flesh dragged by violence, and to suffer the indignity of being torn
  by a youthful arm? which things you will suffer. Do not, I pray thee, for
  it is not seemly. But, my dear mother, give me thy beloved hand, and
  grant me to join cheek to cheek; since never hereafter, but now for the
  last time shall I behold the rays of the sun and his bright orb. Receive
  my last address, O mother! O thou that bearedst me, I am going below.</p>

  <p>HEC. And I, O daughter, shall be a slave in the light of day.</p>

  <p>POLYX. Without the bridegroom, without the bridal song, which I ought
  to have obtained.</p>

  <p>HEC. Mournful thou, my child; but I am a wretched woman.</p>

  <p>POLYX. There shall I lie in darkness far from thee.</p>

  <p>HEC. Alas me, what shall I do? where end my life?</p>

  <p>POLYX. I shall die a slave, born of a free father.</p>

  <p>HEC. But I bereft indeed of fifty children.</p>

  <p>POLYX. What message shall I bear to Hector, and to thy aged
  husband?</p>

  <p>HEC. Tell them that I am most miserable of all women.</p>

  <p>POLYX. O ye breasts that tenderly nursed me.</p>

  <p>HEC. O daughter of an untimely and unhappy fate.</p>

  <p>POLYX. Farewell, O mother, farewell Cassandra too.</p>

  <p>HEC. Others farewell, but this is not for thy mother.</p>

  <p>POLYX. Farewell, my brother Polydore, among the warlike Thracians.</p>

  <p>HEC. If he lives at least: but I doubt, so unfortunate am I in every
  thing.</p>

  <p>POLTX. He lives, and shall close thy dying eye.</p>

  <p>HEC. I am dead, before my death, beneath my ills.</p>

  <p>POLYX. Lead me, Ulysses, having covered my face with a veil, since,
  before I am sacrificed indeed, I am melted in heart at my mother's
  plaints, her also I melt by my lamentations. O light, for yet it is
  allowed me to express thy name, but I have no share in thee, except
  during the time that I am going between the sword and the pyre of
  Achilles.</p>

  <p>HEC. Ah me! I faint; and my limbs fail me.&mdash;O daughter, touch thy
  mother, stretch forth thy hand&mdash;give it me&mdash;leave me not
  childless&mdash;I am lost, my friends. Would that I might see the Spartan
  Helen, the sister of the twin sons of Jove, thus, for through her bright

<p class="center">TALTHYBIUS, HECUBA, CHORUS.</p>

  <p>TAL. Tell me, ye Trojan dames, where can I find Hecuba, late the queen
  of Troy?</p>

  <p>CHOR. Not far from thee, O Talthybius, she is lying stretched on the
  ground, muffled in her robes.</p>

  <p>TAL. O Jupiter, what shall I say? Shall I say that thou beholdest
  mortals? or that they have to no end or purpose entertained false
  notions, who suppose the existence of a race of Deities, and that fortune
  has the sovereign control over men? Was not this the queen of the opulent
  Phrygians? was not this the wife of the all-blest Priam? And now all her
  city is overthrown by the spear, but she a captive, aged, childless, lies
  on the ground defiling her ill-fated head with the dust. Alas! alas! I
  too am old, but rather may death be my portion before I am involved in
  any such debasing fortune; stand up, oh unhappy, raise thy side, and lift
  up thy hoary head.</p>

  <p>HEC. Let me alone: who art thou that sufferest not my body to rest?
  why dost thou, whoever thou art, disturb me from my sadness?</p>

  <p>TAL. I am here, Talthybius, the herald of the Greeks, Agamemnon having
  sent me for thee, O lady.</p>

  <p>HEC. Hast thou come then, thou dearest of men, it having been decreed
  by the Greeks to slay me too upon the tomb? Thou wouldest bring dear news
  indeed. Then haste we, let us speed with all our might: lead on, old
  man.</p>

  <p>TAL. I am here and come to thee, O lady, that thou mayest entomb thy
  dead daughter. Both the two sons of Atreus and the Grecian host send
  me.</p>

  <p>HEC. Alas! what wilt thou say? Art thou not come for me as doomed to
  death, but to bring this cruel message? Thou art dead, my child, torn
  from thy mother; and I am childless as far as regards thee; oh! wretch
  that I am. But how did ye slay her? was it with becoming reverence? Or
  did ye proceed in your butchery as with an enemy, O old man? Tell me,
  though you will relate no pleasing tale.</p>

  <p>TAL. Twice, O lady, thou desirest me to indulge in tears through pity
  for thy daughter; for both now while relating the mournful circumstance
  shall I bedew this eye, as did I then at the tomb when she perished. The
  whole host of the Grecian army was present before the tomb, at the
  sacrifice of thy daughter. But the son of Achilles taking Polyxena by the
  hand, placed her on the summit of the mound; but I stood near him: and
  there followed a chosen band of illustrious youths in readiness to
  restrain with their hands thy daughter's struggles; then the son of
  Achilles took a full-crowned goblet of entire gold, and poured forth
  libations to his deceased father; and makes signal to me to proclaim
  silence through all the Grecian host. And I standing forth in the midst,
  thus spoke: "Be silent, O ye Greeks, let all the people remain silent;
  silence, be still:" and I made the people perfectly still. But he said,
  "O son of Peleus, O my father, accept these libations which have the
  power of soothing, and which speed the dead on their way; and come, that
  thou mayest drink the pure purple blood of this virgin, which both the
  army and myself offer unto thee; but be propitious to us, and grant us to
  weigh anchor, and to loose the cables of our ships, and to return each to
  his country, having met with a prosperous return from Troy." Thus much he
  said, and all the army joined in the prayer. Then taking by the hilt his
  sword decked with gold, he drew it from its scabbard, and made signs to
  the chosen youths of the Greeks to hold the virgin. But she, when she
  perceived it,<a name="Hec_11"></a><a href="#HecN_11"><sup>[11]</sup></a>
  uttered this speech: "O Argives, ye that destroyed my city, I die
  willingly; let none touch my body; for I will offer my neck to the sword
  with a good heart. But, by the Gods, let me go free while ye kill me,
  that I may die free, for to be classed as a slave among the dead, when a
  queen, is what I am ashamed of." But the people murmured assent, and king
  Agamemnon ordered the young men to quit the virgin; [but they, soon as
  they heard the last words of him who had the seat of chief authority
  among them, let go their hold,] and she, on hearing this speech of her
  lords, took her robe, and rent it, beginning from the top of her shoulder
  down to her waist: and showed her breasts and bosom beauteous, as a
  statue's, and bending her knee on the ground, spoke words the most
  piteous ever heard, "Lo! strike, if this bosom thou desirest, O youth; or
  wouldest thou rather under the neck, here is this throat prepared." But
  he at once resolved and unresolved through pity of the virgin, cuts with
  the sword the passage of her breath; and fountains of blood burst forth.
  But she, e'en in death, showed much care to fall decently, and to veil
  from the eyes of men what ought to be concealed. But after that she
  breathed forth her spirit under the fatal blow, not one of the Greeks
  exercised the same offices; but some scattered leaves from their hands on
  the dead; some heap the funeral pile, bringing whole trunks of pines: but
  he that would not bring, heard rebukes of this sort from him that was
  thus employed: "Standest thou idle, thou man of most mean spirit? Hast in
  thy hand no robe, no ornament for the maiden? Hast thou naught to give to
  her so exceeding brave in heart and most noble in soul?" These things I
  tell thee of the death of thy daughter, but I behold thee at once the
  most happy, at once the most unhappy of all women in thine offspring.</p>

  <p>CHOR. Dreadful calamities have risen fierce against the house of
  Priam; such the hard fate of the Gods.</p>

  <p>HEC. O daughter! which of my ills I shall first attend to, amidst such
  a multitude, I know not: for if I touch on any, another does not suffer
  me; and thence again some fresh grief draws me aside, succeeding miseries
  upon miseries. And now I can not obliterate from my mind thy sufferings,
  so as not to bewail them: but excess of grief hast thou taken away,
  having been reported to me as noble. Is it then no paradox, if land
  indeed naturally bad, when blest with a favorable season from heaven,
  bears well the ear; but good land, robbed of the advantages it ought to
  have, brings forth bad fruit: but ever among men, the bad by nature is
  nothing else but bad; the good always good, nor under misfortune does he
  degenerate from his nature, but is the same good man? Is it, that the
  parents cause this difference, or the education? The being brought up
  nobly hath indeed in it the knowledge and principles of goodness; but if
  one is acquainted well with this, he knows what is vicious, having
  already learned it by the rule of virtue. And this indeed has my mind
  been ejaculating in vain. But do thou go, and signify these things to the
  Greeks, that no one be suffered to touch my daughter, but bid them keep
  off the multitude. In so vast an army the rabble are riotous, and the
  sailors' uncontrolled insolence is fiercer than fire; and he is evil, who
  does not evil. But do thou, my old attendant, taking an urn, fill it with
  sea water, and bring it hither, that I may wash my girl in her last bath,
  the bride no bride now, and the virgin no longer a virgin, wash her, and
  lay her out; according to her merits&mdash;whence can I? This I can not;
  but as I can, I will, for what can I do! And collecting ornaments from
  among the captured women, who dwell beside me in these tents, if any one,
  unobserved by our new lords, has by her any stolen memorial of her home.
  O state of my house, O mansions once happy! O Priam, of vast wealth
  possessed, and supremely blest in thine offspring, and I too, this aged
  woman, the mother of such children! How have we come to nothing, bereft
  of our former grandeur! And yet still forsooth we are elated, one of us
  in his gorgeous palaces; another, when honored among his citizens. These
  are nothing. In vain the counsels of the mind, and the tongue's boast. He
  is most blest, to whom from day to day no evil happens.</p>

<p class="center">CHORUS.</p>

  <p>Against me was it fated that calamity, against me was it fated that
  woe should spring, when Paris first hewed the pine in Ida's forest,
  preparing to cut his way over the ocean surge to the bed of Helen, the
  fairest that the sun's golden beams shine upon. For toils, and fate more
  stern than toils, close us round: and from the folly of one came a public
  calamity fatal to the land of Simois, and woes springing from other woes:
  and when the dispute was decided, which the shepherd decided between the
  three daughters of the blessed Gods on Ida's top, for war, and slaughter,
  and the desolation of my palaces. And many a Spartan virgin at her home
  on the banks of the fair-flowing Eurotas sighs while bathed in tears: and
  many an aged matron strikes her hand against her hoary head, for her
  children who have perished, and tears her cheek making her nails all
  blood-stained with her wounds.</p>

<p class="center">FEMALE ATTENDANT, CHORUS, HECUBA.</p>

  <p>ATT. O attendants, where, I pray, is the all-wretched Hecuba, who
  surpasses the whole race of man and woman kind in calamities? no one
  shall wrest from her the crown.</p>

  <p>CHOR. But what dost thou want, O wretch, in thy words of ill omen? for
  thy messages of woe never rest.</p>

  <p>ATT. I bring this grief to Hecuba; but in calamity 'tis no easy thing
  for men to speak words of good import.</p>

  <p>CHOR. And see, she is coming out of the house, and appears in the
  right time for thy words.</p>

  <p>ATT. O all-wretched mistress, and yet still more wretched than I can
  express in words, thou art undone, and no longer beholdest the light,
  childless, husbandless, cityless, entirely destroyed.</p>

  <p>HEC. Thou has said nothing new, but hast reproached me who already
  know it: but why dost thou bring this corse of my Polyxena, whose
  sepulture was reported to me as in a state of active progress through the
  labors of all the Grecians?</p>

  <p>ATT. She nothing knows, but, woe's me! laments Polyxena, nor does she
  apprehend her new misfortunes.</p>

  <p>HEC. O wretched me! dost bring hither the body of the frantic and
  inspired Cassandra?</p>

  <p>ATT. She whom thou mentionedst, lives; but thou dost not weep for him
  who is dead; but behold this corse cast naked [on the shore,] and look if
  it will appear to thee a wonder, and what thou little expectest.</p>

  <p>HEC. Alas me! I do indeed see my son Polydore a corse, whom (<i>I
  fondly hoped</i>) the man of Thrace was preserving in his palace. Now am
  I lost indeed, I no longer exist. Oh my child, my child! Alas! I begin
  the Bacchic strain, having lately learned my woes from my evil
  genius.</p>

  <p>ATT. Thou knowest then the calamity of thy son, O most
  unfortunate.</p>

  <p>HEC. I see incredible evils, still fresh, still fresh: and my
  immeasurable woes follow one upon the other. No longer will a day without
  a tear, without a groan, have part with me.</p>

  <p>CHOR. Dreadful, oh! dreadful are the miseries that we endure!</p>

  <p>HEC. O child, child of a wretched mother, by what fate art thou dead,
  by what hap liest thou here? by the hand of what man?</p>

  <p>ATT. I know not: on the wave-washed shore I found him.</p>

  <p>HEC. Cast up from the sea, or fallen by the blood-stained spear? (Note
  <a name="Hec_C"></a><a href="#HecN_C">[C]</a>.)</p>

  <p>ATT. The ocean's billow cast him up from the deep on the smooth
  sand.</p>

  <p>HEC. Woe is me! Now understand I the dream, the vision of mine eyes;
  the black-winged phantom has not flitted by me in vain, which I saw
  concerning thee, my child, as being no longer in the light of day.</p>

  <p>CHOR. But who slew him? canst thou, O skilled in dreams, declare
  him?</p>

  <p>HEC. My friend, my friend, who curbs the steed in Thrace, where his
  aged father placed him for concealment.</p>

  <p>CHOR. Ah me! what wilt thou say? Was it to possess his gold that he
  slew him!</p>

  <p>HEC. Unutterable deeds, unworthy of a name, surpassing miracles,
  unhallowed, insufferable! Where are the laws of hospitality? O most
  accurst of men, how didst thou mar that skin, how sever with the cruel
  sword the poor limbs of this boy, nor didst feel pity?</p>

  <p>CHOR. O hapless woman, how has the deity made thee by far the most
  wretched of mortals, whoever he be that presses heavy on thee! But, my
  friends, let us henceforward be silent, for I see our lord Agamemnon
  advancing.</p>

<p class="center">AGAMEMNON, CHORUS, HECUBA.</p>

  <p>AGA. Why, Hecuba, delayest thou to come, and bury thy girl in her
  tomb, agreeably to what Talthybius told me, that no one of the Argives
  should be suffered to touch thy daughter. For our part we leave her
  alone, and touch her not; but thou art slow, whereat I am astonished. I
  am come therefore to fetch thee, for every thing there has been well and
  duly performed, if aught of well there be in this. Ah! what corse is this
  I see before the tent? some Trojan's too? for that it is no Grecian's,
  the robes that vest his limbs inform me.</p>

  <p>HEC. (<i>aside</i>) Thou ill-starr'd wretch! myself I mean, when I say
  "thou." O Hecuba, what shall I do? Shall I fall at the knees of Agamemnon
  here, or bear my ills in silence?</p>

  <p>AGA. Why dost lament turning thy back upon me, and sayest not what has
  happened? Who is this?</p>

  <p>HEC. (<i>aside</i>) But should he, thinking me a slave, an enemy,
  spurn me from his knees, I should be adding to my present sufferings.</p>

  <p>AGA. No prophet I, so as to trace, unless by hearing, the path of thy
  counsels.</p>

  <p>HEC. (<i>aside</i>) Am I not rather then putting an evil construction
  on this man's thoughts, whereas he has no evil intention toward me?</p>

  <p>AGA. If thou art willing that I should nothing of this affair, thou
  art of a mind with me, for neither do I wish to hear.</p>

  <p>HEC. (<i>aside</i>) I can not without him take vengeance for my
  children. Why do I thus hesitate? I must be bold, whether I succeed, or
  fail. Agamemnon, by these knees, and by thy beard I implore thee, and by
  thy blessed hand&mdash;</p>

  <p>AGA. What thy request? Is it to pass thy life in freedom? for this is
  easy for thee to obtain.</p>

  <p>HEC. Not this indeed; but so that I avenge myself on the bad, I am
  willing to pass my whole life in slavery.</p>

  <p>AGA. And for what assistance dost thou call on me?</p>

  <p>HEC. In none of those things which thou imaginest, O king. Seest thou
  this corse, o'er which I drop the tear?</p>

  <p>AGA. I see it; thy meaning however I can not learn from this.</p>

  <p>HEC. Him did I once bring forth, him bore I in my bosom.</p>

  <p>AGA. Is this indeed one of thy children, O unhappy woman?</p>

  <p>HEC. It is, but not of the sons of Priam who fell under the walls of
  Troy.</p>

  <p>AGA. Didst thou then bear any other besides those, O lady?</p>

  <p>HEC. In vain, as it appears, this whom you see.</p>

  <p>AGA. But where did he chance to be, when the city fell?</p>

  <p>HEC. His father sent him out of the country, dreading his death.</p>

  <p>AGA. Whither, having removed him alone of his children then alive?</p>

  <p>HEC. To this country, where he was found a corse.</p>

  <p>AGA. To him who is king over this state, to Polymestor?</p>

  <p>HEC. Hither was he sent, the guardian of gold, which proved most
  destructive to him.</p>

  <p>AGA. By whose hand then he is dead, and having met with what fate?</p>

  <p>HEC. By whom else should he? The Thracian host slew him.</p>

  <p>AGA. O wretch! was he so inflamed with the desire of obtaining the
  gold?</p>

  <p>HEC. Even so, after he had heard of Troy's disasters.</p>

  <p>AGA. And where didst thou find him, or who brought the body?</p>

  <p>HEC. She, meeting with it on the sea-shore.</p>

  <p>AGA. In quest of it, or occupied in some other employment?</p>

  <p>HEC. She was going to bring from the sea wherewith to bathe
  Polyxena.</p>

  <p>AGA. This friend then, as it seems, murdered him, and after that cast
  him out.</p>

  <p>HEC. To toss upon the waves thus gashing his body.</p>

  <p>AGA. O thou unhappy from thy unmeasured ills!</p>

  <p>HEC. I perish, no woe is left, O Agamemnon.</p>

  <p>AGA. Alas! alas! What woman was ever so unfortunate?</p>

  <p>HEC. There is none, except you reckon Misfortune herself. But for what
  cause I fall at thy knees, now hear: if I appear to you to suffer these
  ills justly, I would be reconciled to them; but if otherwise, be thou my
  avenger on this man, this most impious of false friends; who revering
  neither the Gods beneath<a name="Hec_12"></a><a
  href="#HecN_12"><sup>[12]</sup></a> the earth, nor the Gods above, hath
  done this most unholy deed, having often partaken of the same table with
  me, [and in the list of hospitality the first of my friends; and having
  met with whatever was due,<a name="Hec_13"></a><a
  href="#HecN_13"><sup>[13]</sup></a> and having received a full
  consideration for his services,<a name="Hec_14"></a><a
  href="#HecN_14"><sup>[14]</sup></a>] slew him, and deigned not to give
  him a tomb, <i>which he might have given</i>, although he purposed to
  slay him, but cast him forth at the mercy of the waves. We indeed are
  slaves, and perhaps weak; but the Gods are strong, and strong the law,
  which governs them; for by the law we judge that there are Gods, and we
  live having justice and injustice strictly defined; which if when
  referred to thee it be disregarded, and they shall suffer no punishment
  who slay their guests, or dare to pollute the hallowed statutes of the
  Gods, there is nothing equitable in the dealings of men. Beholding these
  things then in a base and proper light, reverence me; pity me, and, as
  the artist stands aside <i>to view a picture</i>, do thou view my living
  portrait, and see what woes I am enduring. Once was I a queen, but now I
  am thy slave; once was I blest in my children, but now aged, and at the
  same time childless, cityless, destitute, the most miserable of mortals.
  Alas me wretched! whither withdrawest from me thy foot? It seems<a
  name="Hec_15"></a><a href="#HecN_15"><sup>[15]</sup></a> I shall make no
  impression, wretch that I am. Why then do we mortals toil after all other
  sciences, as a matter of duty, and dive into them, but least of all
  strive to learn thoroughly Persuasion, the sole mistress o'er the minds
  of men, giving a price for her knowledge, that at some time we may have
  it in our power at once to persuade and obtain what we wish?&mdash;How
  then can any one hereafter hope that he shall be fortunate? So many
  children that I had, and now not one is left to me. But I am perishing a
  captive in base servitude, and yet see the smoke there leaping aloft from
  the city. And however this part of my argument may perchance be vain, the
  bringing forward love; still nevertheless it shall be urged. My daughter
  is wont to sleep by thy side, that prophetess, whom the Trojans call
  Cassandra. Where wilt thou show that thy nights were nights of love, O
  king, or will my daughter receive any recompense for her most fond
  embraces, and I through her? [For from the secret shade, and from night's
  joys, the greatest delight is wont to spring to mortals.] Now then
  attend. Thou seest this corse? Him assisting, thou wilt assist one joined
  to thee in affinity. One thing my speech wants yet. I would fain I had a
  voice in my arms, and hands, and in my hair, and in my footsteps, or by
  the skill of Dædalus, or some God, that each at once might hold thy
  knees, weeping, and imploring in all the strains of eloquence. O my lord.
  O greatest light of the Greeks, be persuaded; lend thy hand to avenge
  this aged woman, although she is of no consequence, yet avenge her. For
  it belongs to a good man to minister justice, and always and in every
  case to punish the bad.</p>

  <p>CHOR. It is strange, how every thing happens to mortals, and laws
  determine even the fates, making the greatest enemies friends, and
  enemies of those who before were on good terms.</p>

  <p>AGA. I, O Hecuba, have pity both on thee and thy son, thy misfortunes,
  and thy suppliant touch, and I am willing in regard both to the Gods and
  to justice, that this impious host should give thee full revenge,
  provided a way could be found, that both you might be gratified, and I
  might in the eyes of the army not seem to meditate this destruction
  against the king of Thrace for Cassandra's sake. For there is a point in
  which apprehension hath reached me. This man the army deems a friend, the
  dead an enemy; but if he is dear to thee, this is a private feeling and
  does not affect the army. Wherefore consider, that thou hast me willing
  to labor with thee, and ready to assist thee, but backward, should I be
  murmured against among the Greeks.</p>

  <p>HEC. Alas! no mortal is there who is free. For either he is the slave
  of money or of fortune; or the populace of the city or the dictates of
  the law constrain him to adopt manners not accordant with his natural
  inclinations. But since thou fearest, and payest too much regard to the
  multitude, I will liberate thee from this fear. For consent with me, if I
  meditate vengeance against the murderer of this youth, but do not act
  with me. But should any tumult or offer of assistance arise from out of
  the Greeks, when the Thracian feels the punishment he shall feel,
  suppress it, not appearing to do it for my sake: but of the rest be
  confident: I will dispose all things well.</p>

  <p>AGA. How then? What wilt thou do? Wilt thou grasp the sword in thine
  aged hand, and strike the barbarian? or with poison wilt thou work, or
  with what assistance? What hand will conspire with thee? whence wilt thou
  procure friends?</p>

  <p>HEC. These tents inclose a host of Trojan dames.</p>

  <p>AGA. Meanest thou the captives, the booty of the Greeks?</p>

  <p>HEC. With these will I avenge me of my murderer.</p>

  <p>AGA. And how shall the victory over men be to women?</p>

  <p>HEC. Numbers are powerful, with stratagem invincible.</p>

  <p>AGA. Powerful, I grant; I mistrust however the race of women.</p>

  <p>HEC. And why? Did not women slay the sons of Ægyptus,<a
  name="Hec_16"></a><a href="#HecN_16"><sup>[16]</sup></a> and utterly
  extirpated the race of men from Lemnos?<a name="Hec_17"></a><a
  href="#HecN_17"><sup>[17]</sup></a> But thus let it be. Give up this
  discussion. But grant this woman to pass in safety through the army. And
  do thou go to the Thracian host and tell him, "Hecuba, once queen of
  Troy, sends for you on business of no less importance to yourself than to
  her, and your sons likewise, since it is of consequence that your
  children also should hear her words."&mdash;And do thou, O Agamemnon, as
  yet forbear to raise the tomb over the newly-sacrificed Polyxena, that
  these two, the brother and the sister, the divided care of their mother,
  may, when reduced to ashes by one and the same flame, be interred side by
  side.</p>

  <p>AGA. Thus shall it be. And yet, if the army could sail, I should not
  have it in my power to grant thy request: but now, for the deity breathes
  not prosperous gales, we must wait, watching for a calm voyage. But may
  things turn out well some way or other: for this is a general principle
  among all, both individuals in private and states, That the wicked man
  should feel vengeance, but the good man enjoy prosperity.</p>

<p class="center">CHORUS.</p>

  <p>O thou, my country of Troy, no longer shall thou be called the city of
  the invincible, such a cloud of Grecians envelops thee, with the spear,
  with the spear having destroyed thee. And thou hast been shorn of thy
  crown of turrets, and thou hast been discolored by the dismal blackness
  of smoke; hapless city, no longer shall I tread my steps in thee.</p>

  <p>In the midnight hour I perished, when after the feast sweet sleep is
  scattered over the eyes. And my husband, from the song and cheerful
  sacrifice retired, was sleeping peacefully in my bed, his spear on its
  peg, no more dreaming to behold the naval host of the Greeks treading the
  streets of Troy. But I was binding my braided hair with fillets fastened
  on the top of mine head, looking into the round polished surface of the
  golden mirror, that I might get into my bed prepared for me. On a sudden
  a tumultuous cry penetrated the city; and this shout of exhortation was
  heard in the streets of Troy, "When indeed, ye sons of Grecians, when,
  <i>if not now</i>, will ye return to your homes having overthrown the
  proud citadel of Ilium!" And having left my dear bed, in a single robe,
  like a Spartan virgin, flying for aid to the venerable shrine of Diana, I
  hapless fled in vain. And I am dragged, after having seen my husband
  slain, to the ocean waves; and casting a distant look back upon my city,
  after the vessel had begun her way in her return to Greece, and divided
  me from the land of Troy, I wretched fainted through anguish. And
  consigning to curses Helen, the sister of the Twin Brothers, and the
  Idean shepherd, the ruthless Paris, since his marriage, no marriage, but
  some Fury's hate hath utterly destroyed me far from my native land, and
  hath driven me from my home. Whom may the ocean refuse ever to bear back
  again; and may she never reach again her paternal home.</p>

<p class="center">POLYMESTOR, HECUBA, CHORUS.</p>

  <p>POLY. O Priam, thou dearest of men, and thou most dear Hecuba, at thy
  sight I weep for thee, and thy city, and thy daughter who has lately
  died. Alas! there is nothing secure, neither glory, nor when one is
  faring well is there a certainty that he will not fare ill. But the Gods
  mingle these things promiscuously to and fro, making all confusion, so
  that we through ignorance may worship them. But wherefore should I utter
  these plaints, which in no way tend to free thee from thy former
  calamities. But thou, if thou hast aught to blame for my absence,
  forbear; for I chanced to be afar off in the middle of my Thracian
  territories, when thou camest hither; but soon as I returned, as I was
  already setting out from my house, this maid of thine met me for the
  self-same purpose, and delivered thy message, which when I had heard, I
  came.</p>

  <p>HEC. O Polymestor, I am ashamed to look thee in the face, sunk as I am
  in such miseries; for before one who has seen me in prosperity, shame
  overwhelms me, being in the state in which I now am, nor can I look upon
  thee with unmoved eyes. But impute not this to any enmity I bear thee;
  but there are other causes, and in some degree this law; "that women
  ought not to gaze at men."</p>

  <p>POLY. And 'tis indeed no wonder; but what need hast thou of me? for
  what purpose didst thou send for me to come from home?</p>

  <p>HEC. I am desirous of communicating a private affair of my own to thee
  and thy children; but order thy attendants to retire from these
  tents.</p>

  <p>POLY. Depart, for here to be alone is safe. Friendly thou art, this
  Grecian army too is friendly toward me, but it is for thee to signify, in
  what manner I, who am in good circumstances, ought to succor my friends
  in distress; since, on my part, I am ready.</p>

  <p>HEC. First then tell me of my son Polydore, whom thou retainest,
  receiving him from mine, and from his father's hand, if he live; but the
  rest I shall inquire of thee afterward.</p>

  <p>POLY. He lives, and in good health; as far as regards him indeed thou
  art happy.</p>

  <p>HEC. O my best friend, how well thou speakest, and how worthily of
  thyself!</p>

  <p>POLY. What dost thou wish then to inquire of me in the next place?</p>

  <p>HEC. Whether he remembers at all me, his mother?</p>

  <p>POLY. Yes: and he even sought to come to thee by stealth.</p>

  <p>HEC. And is the gold safe, which he brought with him from Troy?</p>

  <p>POLY. It is safe, at least it is guarded in my house.</p>

  <p>HEC. Preserve it therefore, nor covet the goods of others.</p>

  <p>POLY. Certainly not. May I enjoy what is mine own, O lady.</p>

  <p>HEC. Knowest thou then, what I wish to say to thee and thy
  children?</p>

  <p>POLY. I do not: this shalt thou signify by thy speech.</p>

  <p>HEC. Be my son loved by thee, as thou art now loved of me.</p>

  <p>POLY. What is it, that I and my sons must know?</p>

  <p>HEC. The ancient buried treasures of the family of Priam.</p>

  <p>POLY. Is it this thou wishest me to inform thy son of?</p>

  <p>HEC. Yes, certainly; through thee at least, for thou art a pious
  man.</p>

  <p>POLY. What necessity then is there for the presence of these
  children?</p>

  <p>HEC. 'Tis better in case of thy death, that these should know.</p>

  <p>POLY. Well hast thou thus said, and 'tis the wiser plan.</p>

  <p>HEC. Thou knowest then where the temple of Minerva in Troy
  is&mdash;</p>

  <p>POLY. Is the gold there! but what is the mark?</p>

  <p>HEC. A black rock rising above the earth.</p>

  <p>POLY. Hast any thing further to tell me of what is there?</p>

  <p>HEC. No, but I wish thee to take care of some treasures, with which I
  came out of the city.</p>

  <p>POLY. Where are they then? Hast thou them hidden beneath thy
  robes?</p>

  <p>HEC. Amidst a heap of spoils they are preserved in this tent.</p>

  <p>POLY. But where? These are the naval encampments of the Grecians.</p>

  <p>HEC. The habitations of the captive women are private.</p>

  <p>POLY. And is all secure within, and untenanted by men?</p>

  <p>HEC. Not one of the Greeks is within, but we women only. But come into
  the tent, for the Greeks are desirous of loosing the sheets of their
  vessels homeward from Troy; so that, having done every thing that thou
  oughtest, thou mayest go with thy children to that place where thou hast
  given my son to dwell.</p>

  <p>CHOR. Not yet hast thou suffered, but peradventure thou wilt suffer
  vengeance; as a man falling headlong into the gulf where no harbor is,
  shalt thou be hurled from thy dear heart, having lost thy life;<a
  name="Hec_18"></a><a href="#HecN_18"><sup>[18]</sup></a> for where the
  rites of hospitality coincide<a name="Hec_19"></a><a
  href="#HecN_19"><sup>[19]</sup></a> with justice, and with the Gods,
  <i>on the villain who dares to violate these</i> destructive, destructive
  indeed impends the evil. But thy hopes will deceive thee, which thou
  entertainedst from this journey, which has brought thee, thou wretched
  man, to the deadly mansions of Pluto; but thou shalt quit thy life by no
  warrior's hand.</p>

<p class="center">POLYMESTOR, HECUBA, SEMICHORUS.</p>

  <p>POLY. Oh me! I wretch am deprived of the sight of mine eyes.</p>

  <p>SEMI. Heard ye the shriek of the man of Thrace, my friends?</p>

  <p>POLY. Oh me; there again&mdash;Oh my children, thy miserable
  butchery!</p>

  <p>SEMI. My friends, some strange ills have been perpetrated within the
  tents.</p>

  <p>POLY. But for all your nimble feet, ye never can escape me, for by my
  blows will I burst open the recesses of these tents.</p>

  <p>SEMI. Behold, he uses violently the weapon of his heavy hand. Will ye
  that we fall on; since the instant calls on us to be present with
  assistance to Hecuba and the Trojan dames?</p>

  <p>HEC. Dash on, spare nothing, break down the gates, for thou never
  shalt replace the clear sight in those pupils, nor shalt thou behold
  alive those children which I have slain.</p>

  <p>SEMI. What! hast thou vanquished the Thracian? and hast thou got the
  mastery over this host, my mistress? and hast thou done such deeds, as
  thou sayest?</p>

  <p>HEC. Thou wilt see him quickly before the house, blind, with blind
  wandering steps approaching, and the bodies of his two children, whom I
  have slain with these most valiant Trojan women; but he has felt my
  vengeance; but he is coming as thou seest from the tent. But I will
  retire out of his way, and make good my retreat from the boiling rage of
  this most desperate Thracian.</p>

  <p>POLY. Alas me! whither can I go? where stand? whither shall I direct
  my way, advancing my steps like the four-footed mountain beast on my
  hands and on my feet in pursuit? What new path shall I take in this
  direction or in that, desirous of seizing these murderous Trojan dames,
  who have utterly destroyed me; O ye impious, impious Phrygian daughters!
  Ah the accursed, in what corner do they shrink from me in flight? Would
  that thou, O sun, could'st heal, could'st heal these bleeding lids of my
  eyes, and remove this gloomy-darkness. Ah, hush, hush! I hear the
  carefully-concealed step of these women. Whither shall I direct my course
  in order that I may glut myself on the flesh and bones of these, making
  the wild beasts' banquet, inflicting vengeance on them, in return for the
  injuries done me. Wretch that I am! Whither, whither am I borne, having
  left my children deserted, for these fiends of hell to tear piecemeal, a
  mangled, bleeding, savage prey to dogs, and a thing to cast out on the
  mountains? Where shall I stand? Whither turn? Whither go, as a ship
  setting her yellow canvas sails with her sea-washed palsers, rushing to
  this lair of death, the protector of my children?</p>

  <p>CHOR. O miserable man, what intolerable evils have been perpetrated by
  thee! but on thee having done base deeds the God hath sent dreadful
  punishment, whoever he be that presses heavy on thee.</p>

  <p>POLY. Alas! alas! O Thracian nation, brandishing the spear, warlike,
  bestriding the steed, nation ruled by Mars; O ye Greeks, sons of Atreus;
  I raise the cry, the cry, the cry; Come, come, hasten, I entreat you by
  the Gods. Does any hear, or will no one assist me? Why do ye delay? The
  women have destroyed me, the captive women. Horrible, horrible treatment
  have I suffered. Alas me for my ruin! Whither can I turn? Whither can I
  go? Shall I soar through the ethereal skies to the lofty mansions where
  Orion or Sirius dart from their eyes the flaming rays of fire: or shall I
  hapless rush to the gloomy shore of Pluto?</p>

  <p>CHOR. It is pardonable, when any one suffers greater misfortunes than
  he can bear, for him to be desirous to quit a miserable life.</p>

<p class="center">AGAMEMNON, POLYMESTOR, HECUBA, CHORUS.</p>

  <p>AGA. I came having heard the clamor: for Echo, the mountain's
  daughter, did not sound in gentle strains through the army, causing a
  disturbance. But did we not know that the Phrygian towers are fallen
  beneath the Grecian spear, this tumult might have caused no little
  terror.</p>

  <p>POLY. O my dearest friend (for I know thee, Agamemnon, having heard
  thy voice), seest thou what I am suffering?</p>

  <p>AGA. Ah! wretched Polymestor, who hath destroyed thee? who made thine
  eyes sightless, having drowned their orbs in blood? And who hath slain
  these thy children? Sure, whoe'er it was, felt the greatest rage against
  thee and thy sons.</p>

  <p>POLY. Hecuba with the female captives hath destroyed me&mdash;nay, not
  destroyed me, but more than destroyed me.</p>

  <p>AGA. What sayest thou? Hast thou done this deed, as he affirms? Hast
  thou, Hecuba, dared this inconceivable act of boldness?</p>

  <p>POLY. Ah me! what wilt thou say? Is she any where near me? Show me,
  tell me where she is, that I may seize her in my hands, and tear
  piecemeal and mangle her body.</p>

  <p>AGA. What ho! what are you doing?</p>

  <p>POLY. By the Gods I entreat thee, suffer me to lay my raging hand upon
  her.</p>

  <p>AGA. Forbear. And having banished this barbarous deed from thy
  thoughts, speak; that having heard both thee and her in your respective
  turns, I may decide justly, in return for what thou art suffering these
  ills.</p>

  <p>POLY. I will speak then. There was a certain youth, the youngest of
  Priam's children, by name Polydore, the son of Hecuba; him his father
  Priam sent to me from Troy to bring up in my palace, already presaging<a
  name="Hec_20"></a><a href="#HecN_20"><sup>[20]</sup></a> the capture of
  Troy. Him I put to death. But for what cause I put him to death, with
  what policy and prudent forethought, now hear. I feared, lest the boy
  being left an enemy to thee, should collect the scattered remnants of
  Troy, and again people the city. And lest the Greeks, having discovered
  that one of the sons of Priam was alive, should again direct an
  expedition against the Phrygian land, and after that should harass and
  lay waste the plains of Thrace; and it might fare ill with the neighbors
  of the Trojans, under which misfortune, O king, we are now laboring. But
  Hecuba, when she had discovered her son's death, by such treachery as
  this lured me hither, as about to tell me of treasure belonging to
  Priam's family concealed in Troy, and introduces me alone with my sons
  into the tent, that no one else might know it. And I sat, having reclined
  on the centre of the couch; but many Trojan damsels, some from the left
  hand, and others from the right, sat round me, as by an intimate friend,
  holding in their hands the Edonian looms, and praised these robes,
  looking at them in the light; but others, beholding with admiration my
  Thracian spear, deprived me of my double ornament. But as many as were
  mothers caressed my children in their arms in seeming admiration, that
  they might be farther removed from their father, successively handing
  them from one to another: and then, amidst their kind blandishments, what
  think you? in an instant, snatching from somewhere beneath their garments
  their daggers, they stab my children. But they having seized me in an
  hostile manner held my hands and feet; and if, wishing to succor my
  children, I raised my head, they held me by the hair: but if I attempted
  to move my hands, I wretched could effect nothing through the host of
  women. But at last, cruelty and worse than cruelty, they perpetrated
  dreadful things; for having taken their clasps they pierce and gore the
  wretched pupils of my eyes, then vanish in flight through the tent. But
  I, having leaped out, like some exasperated beast, pursue the
  blood-stained wretches, searching every wall, as the hunter, casting
  down, rending. This have I suffered, while studious to advance thy
  interest, Agamemnon, and having killed thine enemy. But that I may not
  extend my speech to a greater length, if any one of those of ancient
  times hath reviled women, or if any one doth now, or shall hereafter
  revile them, I will comprise the whole when I say, that such a race
  neither doth the sea nor the earth produce, but he who is always with
  them knows it best.</p>

  <p>CHOR. Be not at all insolent, nor, in thy calamities, thus
  comprehending the female sex, abuse them all. For of us there are many,
  some indeed are envied <i>for their virtues</i>, but some are by nature
  in the catalogue of bad things.</p>

  <p>HEC. Agamemnon, it never were fitting among men that the tongue should
  have greater force than actions. But if a man has acted well, well should
  he speak; if on the other hand basely, his words likewise should be
  unsound, and never ought he to be capable of speaking unjust things well.
  Perhaps indeed they who have brought these things to a pitch of accuracy
  are accounted wise, but they can not endure wise unto the end, but perish
  vilely, nor has any one yet escaped this. And this in my prelude is what
  I have to say to thee. Now am I going to direct my discourse to this man,
  and I will answer his arguments. Thou, that assertest, that in order to
  rid the Greeks of their redoubled toil, and for Agamemnon's sake that
  thou didst slay my son? But, in the first place, monstrous villain, never
  can the race of barbarians be friendly to the Grecians, never can this
  take place. But what favor wert thou so eagerly currying? wert thou about
  to contract an alliance, or was it that thou wert of kindred birth, or
  what pretext hadst thou? or were they about to ravage the crops of thy
  country, having sailed thither again? Whom, thinkest thou, wilt thou
  persuade of these things? The gold, if thou wert willing to speak truth,
  the gold destroyed my son, and thy base gains. For come, tell me this;
  how when Troy was prosperous, and a tower yet girt around the city, and
  Priam lived, and the spear of Hector was in its glory, why didst thou not
  then, if thou wert willing to lay him under this obligation, bringing up
  my child, and retaining him in thy palace, why didst thou not then slay
  him, or go and take him alive to the Greeks? But when we were no longer
  in the light of prosperity, and the city by its smoke showed that it was
  in the power of the enemy, thou slewest thy guest who had come to thy
  hearth. Now hear besides how thou wilt appear vile: thou oughtest, if
  thou wert the friend of the Greeks, to have given the gold, which thou
  confessedst thou hast, not thine, but his, distributing to those who were
  in need, and had long been strangers to their native land. But thou, even
  now, hast not courage to part with it from thy hand, but having it, thou
  still art keeping it close in thine house. And yet, in bringing up my
  child, as it was thy duty to bring him up, and in preserving him, thou
  hadst had fair honor. For in adversity friends are most clearly proved
  good. But good circumstances have in every case their friends. But if
  thou wert in want of money, and he in a flourishing condition, my son had
  been to thee a vast treasure; but now, thou neither hast him for thy
  friend, and the benefit from the gold is gone, and thy sons are gone, and
  thou art&mdash;as thou art. But to thee, Agamemnon, I say; if thou aidest
  this man, thou wilt appear to be doing wrong. For thou wilt be conferring
  a benefit on a host, who is neither pious, nor faithful to those to whom
  he ought, not holy, not just. But we shall say that thou delightest in
  the bad, if thus thou actest: but I speak no offense to my lords.</p>

  <p>CHOR. Ah! Ah! How do good deeds ever supply to men the source of good
  words!</p>

  <p>AGA. Thankless my office to decide on others' grievances; but still I
  must, for it brings disgrace on a man, having taken a thing in hand, to
  give it up. But to me, be assured, thou neither appearest for my sake,
  nor for the sake of the Grecians, to have killed this man thy guest, but
  that thou mightest possess the gold in thy palace. But thou talkest of
  thy advantage, when thou art in calamities.<a name="Hec_21"></a><a
  href="#HecN_21"><sup>[21]</sup></a> Perhaps with you it is a slight thing
  to kill your guests; but with us Grecians this thing is abhorred. How
  then, in giving my decision that thou hast not injured, can I escape
  blame? I can not; but as thou hast dared to do things dishonorable,
  endure now things unpleasant.</p>

  <p>POLY. Alas me! worsted, as it seems, by a woman who is a slave, I
  shall submit to the vengeance of my inferiors.</p>

  <p>AGA. Will it not then be justly, seeing thou hast acted wrong?</p>

  <p>POLY. Alas me! wretched on account of these children and on account of
  my eyes.</p>

  <p>HEC. Thou sufferest? but what do I? Thinkest thou I suffer not for my
  child?</p>

  <p>POLY. Thou rejoicest in insulting me, O thou malicious woman.</p>

  <p>HEC. For ought not I to rejoice on having avenged myself on thee?</p>

  <p>POLY. But thou wilt not soon, when the liquid wave&mdash;</p>

  <p>HEC. Shall bear me, <i>dost thou mean</i>, to the confines of the
  Grecian land?</p>

  <p>POLY. &mdash;shall cover thee, having fallen from the shrouds.</p>

  <p>HEC. From whom meeting with this violent leap?</p>

  <p>POLY. Thyself shalt climb with thy feet up the ship's mast.</p>

  <p>HEC. Having wings on my back, or in what way?</p>

  <p>POLY. Thou shalt become a dog with a fiery aspect.</p>

  <p>HEC. But how dost thou know of this my metamorphose?</p>

  <p>POLY. Dionysius the Thracian prophet told it me.</p>

  <p>HEC. But did he not declare to thee any of the evils which thou
  sufferest?</p>

  <p>POLY. No: for, <i>if he had</i>, thou never wouldst thus treacherously
  have taken me.</p>

  <p>HEC. <a name="Hec_22"></a><a href="#HecN_22"><sup>[22]</sup></a>Thence
  shall I conclude my life in death, or still live on?</p>

  <p>POLY. Thou shalt die. But the name of thy tomb shall be&mdash;</p>

  <p>HEC. Dost thou speak of it as in any way correspondent to my
  shape?</p>

  <p>POLY. <a name="Hec_23"></a><a href="#HecN_23"><sup>[23]</sup></a>The
  tomb of the wretched dog, a mark to mariners.</p>

  <p>HEC. I heed it not, since thou at least hast felt my vengeance.</p>

  <p>POLY. And it is fated too for thy daughter Cassandra to die.</p>

  <p>HEC. I renounce these prophecies; I give them for thyself to bear.</p>

  <p>POLY. Him shall his wife slay, a cruel guardian of his house.</p>

  <p>HEC. Never yet may the daughter of Tyndarus have arrived at such
  madness.</p>

  <p>POLY. Even this man himself, having lifted up the axe.</p>

  <p>AGA. What ho! thou art mad, and art desirous of obtaining greater
  ills.</p>

  <p>POLY. Kill me, for the murderous bath at Argos awaits thee.</p>

  <p>AGA. Will ye not, slaves, forcibly drag him from my presence?</p>

  <p>POLY. Thou art galled at what thou hearest.</p>

  <p>AGA. Will ye not stop his mouth?</p>

  <p>POLY. Stop it: for the word is spoken.</p>

  <p>AGA. Will ye not as quick as possible cast him out on some desert
  island, since he is thus, and past endurance insolent? But do thou,
  wretched Hecuba, go and bury thy two dead: and you, O Trojan dames, must
  approach your masters' tents, for I perceive that the gales are favorable
  for wafting us to our homes. And may we sail in safety to our native
  country, and behold our household and families in prosperity, having
  found rest from these toils.</p>

  <p>CHOR. Come, my friends, to the harbor, and the tents, to undergo the
  tasks imposed by our masters. For necessity is relentless.</p>

  <p>The Chorus therefore says, <i>Ubi contingit eundem et Justitiæ et Diis
  esse addictum, exitiale semper malum esse</i>; or, as the learned
  Hemsterheuyse has more fully and more elegantly expressed, it,
  <i>Ubi</i>, id est, <i>in quo</i>, vel <i>in quem cadit et concurrit, ut
  ob crimen commissum simul et humanæ justitiæ et Deorum vindictæ sit
  obnoxius, ac velut oppignoratus; illi certissimum exitium imminet</i>.

<h3>THE ARGUMENT.</h3>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Orestes, in revenge for the murder of his father, took off Ægisthus
  and Clyætmnestra; but having dared to slay his mother, he was instantly
  punished for it by being afflicted with madness. But on Tyndarus, the
  father of her who was slain, laying an accusation against him, the
  Argives were about to give a public decision on this question, "What
  ought he, who has dared this impious deed, to suffer?" By chance
  Menelaus, having returned from his wanderings, sent in Helen indeed by
  night, but himself came by day, and being entreated by Orestes to aid
  him, he rather feared Tyndarus the accuser: but when the speeches came to
  be spoken among the populace, the multitude were stirred up to kill
  Orestes. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* But Pylades, his friend, accompanying him, counseled him
  first to take revenge on Menelaus by killing Helen. As they were going on
  this project, they were disappointed of their hope by the Gods snatching
  away Helen from them. But Electra delivered up Hermione, when she made
  her appearance, into their hands, and they were about to kill her. When
  Menelaus came, and saw himself bereft by them at once of his wife and
  child, he endeavored to storm the palace; but they, anticipating his
  purpose, threatened to set it on fire. Apollo, however, having appeared,
  said that he had conducted Helen to the Gods, and commanded Orestes to
  take Hermione to wife, and Electra to dwell with Pylades, and, after that
  he was purified of the murder, to reign over Argos.</p>

  <p>The scene of the piece is laid at Argos; But the chorus consists of
  Argive women, intimate associates of Electra, who also come on inquiring
  about the calamity of Orestes. The play has a catastrophe rather suited
  to comedy. The opening scene of the play is thus arranged. Orestes is
  discovered before the palace of Agamemnon, fatigued, and, on account of
  his madness, lying on a couch on which Electra is sitting by him at his
  feet. A difficulty has been started, why does not she sit at his head?
  for thus would she seem to watch more tenderly over her brother, if she
  sat nearer him. The poet, it is answered, seems to have made this
  arrangement on account of the Chorus; for Orestes, who had but just then
  and with difficulty gotten to sleep, would have been awakened, if the
  women that constituted the Chorus had stood nearer to him. But this we
  may infer from what Electra says to the Chorus, "<span lang="el"
  title="Siga, siga, lepton ichnos arbylêis">&#x3A3;&#x3B9;&#x3B3;&#x3B1;,
  &#x3C3;&#x3B9;&#x3B3;&#x3B1;, &#x3BB;&#x3B5;&#x3C0;&#x3C4;&#x3BF;&#x3BD;
  &#x3B9;&#x3C7;&#x3BD;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;
  &#x3B1;&#x3C1;&#x3B2;&#x3C5;&#x3BB;&#x3B7;&#x3B9;&#x3C2;</span>." It is
  probable then that the above is the reason of this arrangement.</p>

  <p>The play is among the most celebrated on the stage, but infamous in
  its morals; for, with the exception of Pylades, all the characters are
  bad persons.</p>

<h2>ORESTES.</h2>

<hr class="short" />

<p class="center">ELECTRA.</p>

  <p>There is no word so dreadful to relate, nor suffering, nor
  heaven-inflicted calamity, the burden of which human nature may not be
  compelled to bear. For Tantalus, the blest, (and I am not reproaching his
  fortune, <i>when I say this</i>,) the son of Jupiter, as they report,
  trembling at the rock which impends over his head, hangs in the air, and
  suffers this punishment, as they say indeed, because, although being a
  man, yet having the honor of a table in common with the Gods upon equal
  terms, he possessed an ungovernable tongue, a most disgraceful malady. He
  begat Pelops, and from him sprung Atreus, for whom the Goddess having
  carded the wool<a name="Orest_1"></a><a
  href="#OrestN_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> spun the thread of contention, <i>and
  doomed him</i> to make war on Thyestes his relation; (why must I
  commemorate things unspeakable?) But Atreus then<a name="Orest_2"></a><a
  href="#OrestN_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> killed his children&mdash;and feasted
  him. But from Atreus, for I pass over in silence the misfortunes which
  intervened, sprung Agamemnon, the illustrious, (if he was indeed
  illustrious,) and Menelaus; their mother Aërope of Crete. But Menelaus
  indeed marries Helen, the hated of the Gods, but King Agamemnon
  <i>obtained</i> Clytæmnestra's bed, memorable throughout the Grecians:
  from whom we virgins were born, three from one mother; Chrysothemis, and
  Iphigenia, and myself Electra; and Orestes the male part of the family,
  from a most unholy mother, who slew her husband, having covered him
  around with an inextricable robe; the reason however it is not decorous
  in a virgin to tell; I leave this undeclared for men to consider as they
  will. But why indeed must I accuse the injustice of Ph&#339;bus? Yet
  persuaded he Orestes to kill that mother that brought him forth, a deed
  which gained not a good report from all men. But nevertheless he did slay
  her, as he would not be disobedient to the God. I also took a share in
  the murder, but such as a woman ought to take. As did Pylades also who
  perpetrated this deed with us. From that time wasting away, the wretched
  Orestes is afflicted with a grievous malady, but falling on his couch
  there lies, but his mother's blood whirls him to frenzy (for I dread to
  mention those Goddesses, the Eumenides, who persecute him with terror).
  Moreover this is the sixth day since his slaughtered mother was purified
  by fire as to her body. During which he has neither taken any food down
  his throat, he has not bathed his limbs, but covered beneath his cloak,
  when indeed his body is lightened of its disease, on coming to his right
  mind he weeps, but at another time starts suddenly from his couch, as a
  colt from his yoke. But it has been decreed by this city of Argos, that
  no one shall receive us who have slain a mother under their roof, nor at
  their fire, and that none shall speak to us; but this is the appointed
  day, in the which the city of the Argives will pronounce their vote,
  whether it is fitting that we should die being stoned with stones, or
  having whet the sword, should plunge it into our necks. But I yet have
  some hope that we may not die, for Menelaus has arrived at this country
  from Troy, and filling the Nauplian harbor with his oars is mooring his
  fleet off the shore, having been lost in wanderings from Troy a long
  time: but the much-afflicted Helen has he sent before to our palace,
  having taken advantage of the night, lest any of those, whose children
  died under Ilium, when they saw her coming, by day, might go so far as to
  stone her; but she is within bewailing her sister, and the calamity of
  her family. She has however some consolation in her woes, for the virgin
  Hermione, whom Menelaus bringing from Sparta, left at our palace, when he
  sailed to Troy, and gave as a charge to my mother to bring up, in her she
  rejoices, and forgets her miseries. But I am looking at each avenue when
  I shall see Menelaus present, since, for the rest, we ride on slender
  power,<a name="Orest_3"></a><a href="#OrestN_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> if we
  receive not some succor from him; the house of the unfortunate is an
  embarrassed state of affairs.</p>

<p class="center">ELECTRA. HELEN.</p>

  <p>HEL. O daughter of Clytæmnestra and Agamemnon, O Electra, thou that
  hast remained a virgin a long time. How are ye, O wretched woman, both
  you, and your brother, the wretched Orestes (he was the murderer of his
  mother)? For by thy converse I am not polluted, transferring, as I do,
  the blame to Ph&#339;bus. And yet I groan the death of Clytæmnestra,
  whom, after that I sailed to Troy, (how did I sail, urged by the
  maddening fate of the Gods!) I saw not, but of her bereft I lament my
  fortune.</p>

  <p>ELEC. Helen, why should I inform thee of things thou seest thyself
  here present, the race of Agamemnon in calamities. I indeed sleepless sit
  companion to the wretched corse, (for he is a corse, in that he breathes
  so little,) but at his fortune I murmur not. But thou a happy woman, and
  thy husband a happy man, have come to us, who fare most wretchedly.</p>

  <p>HEL. But what length of time has he been lying on his couch?</p>

  <p>ELEC. Ever since he shed his parent's blood.</p>

  <p>HEL. Oh wretched, and his mother too, that thus she perished!</p>

  <p>ELEC. These things are thus, so that he is unable to speak for
  misery.</p>

  <p>HEL. By the Gods wilt thou oblige me in a thing, O virgin?</p>

  <p>ELEC. As far as I am permitted by the little leisure I have from
  watching by my brother.</p>

  <p>HEL. Wilt thou go to the tomb of my sister?</p>

  <p>ELEC. My mother's tomb dost thou desire? wherefore?</p>

  <p>HEL. Bearing the first offerings of my hair, and my libations.</p>

  <p>ELEC. But is it not lawful for thee to go to the tomb of thy
  friends?</p>

  <p>HEL. No, for I am ashamed to show myself among the Argives.</p>

  <p>ELEC. Late art thou discreet, then formerly leaving thine home
  disgracefully.</p>

  <p>HEL. True hast thou spoken, but thou speakest not pleasantly to
  me.</p>

  <p>ELEC. But what shame possesses thee among the Myceneans?</p>

  <p>HEL. I fear the fathers of those who are dead under Ilium.</p>

  <p>ELEC. For this is a dreadful thing; and at Argos thou art declaimed
  against by every one's mouth.</p>

  <p>HEL. Do thou then grant me this favor, and free me from this fear.</p>

  <p>ELEC. I can not look upon the tomb of my mother.</p>

  <p>HEL. And yet it is disgraceful for servants to bear these.</p>

  <p>ELEC. But why not send thy daughter Hermione?</p>

  <p>HEL. It is not well for virgins to go among the crowd.</p>

  <p>ELEC. And yet she might repay the dead the care of her education.</p>

  <p>HEL. Right hast thou spoken, and I obey thee, O virgin, and I will
  send my daughter, for thou sayest well. Come forth, my child Hermione,
  before the house, and take these libations in thine hand, and my hair,
  and, going to the tomb of Clytæmnestra, leave there this mixture of milk
  and honey, and the froth of wine, and standing on the summit of the
  mound, say thus: "Helen, thy sister, presents thee with these libations,
  in fear herself to approach thy tomb, and afraid of the populace of
  Argos:" and bid her hold kind intentions toward me, and thyself, and my
  husband, and toward these two miserable persons whom the God has
  destroyed. But promise all the offerings to the manes, whatever it is
  fitting that I should perform for a sister. Go, my child, hasten, and
  when thou hast offered the libations at the tomb, remember to return back
  as speedily as possible.</p>

  <p>ELEC. [<i>alone</i>] O Nature, what a great evil art thou among men,
  and the safeguard of those who possess thee, with virtue! For see, how
  she has shorn off the extremities of her hair, in order to preserve her
  beauty; but she is the same woman she always was. May the Gods detest
  thee, for that thou hast destroyed me, and this man, and the whole state
  of Greece: oh wretch that I am! But my dear friends that accompany me in
  my lamentations are again present; perhaps they will disturb the sleeper
  from his slumber, and will melt my eyes in tears when I behold my brother
  raving.</p>

<p class="center">ELECTRA, CHORUS.</p>

  <p>ELEC. O most dear woman, proceed with a gentle foot, make no noise,
  let there be heard no sound. For your friendliness is very kind, but to
  awake him will be a calamity to me. Hush, hush&mdash;gently advance the
  tread of thy sandal, make no noise, let there be heard no sound. Move
  onward from that place&mdash;onward from before the couch.</p>

  <p>CHOR. Behold, I obey.</p>

  <p>ELEC. St! st! Speak to me, my friend, as the breathing of the soft
  reed pipe.</p>

  <p>CHOR. See, I utter a voice low as an under note.</p>

  <p>ELEC. Ay, thus come hither, come hither, approach quietly&mdash;go
  quietly: tell me, for what purpose, I pray, are ye come? For he has
  fallen on his couch, and been sleeping some time.</p>

  <p>CHOR. How is he? Give us an account of him, my friend.</p>

  <p>ELEC. What fortune can I say of him? and what his calamities? still
  indeed he breathes, but sighs at short intervals.</p>

  <p>CHOR. What sayest thou? Oh, the unhappy man!</p>

  <p>ELEC. You will kill him if you move his eyelids, now that he is taking
  the sweetest enjoyment of sleep.</p>

  <p>CHOR. Unfortunate on account of these most angry deeds from heaven!
  oh! wretched on account of thy sufferings!</p>

  <p>ELEC. Alas! alas! Apollo himself unjust, then spoke unjust things,
  when at the tripod of Themis he commanded the unhallowed, inauspicious
  murder of my mother.</p>

  <p>CHOR. Dost thou see? he moves his body in the robes that cover
  him.</p>

  <p>ELEC. You by your cries, O wretch, have disturbed him from his
  sleep.</p>

  <p>CHOR. I indeed think he is sleeping yet.</p>

  <p>ELEC. Will you not depart from us? will you not bend your footsteps
  back from the house, ceasing this noise?</p>

  <p>CHOR. He sleeps.</p>

  <p>ELEC. Thou sayest well.</p>

  <p>CHOR. Venerable, venerable Night, thou that dispensest sleep to
  languid mortals, come from Erebus; come, come, borne on thy wings to the
  house of Agamemnon; for by our griefs and by our sufferings we are quite
  undone, undone.</p>

  <p>ELEC. Ye were making a noise.</p>

  <p>CHOR. No. (Note <a name="Orest_A"></a><a
  href="#OrestN_A">[A]</a>.)</p>

  <p>ELEC. Silently, silently repressing the high notes of your voice,
  apart from his couch, you will enable him to have the tranquil enjoyment
  of sleep.</p>

  <p>CHOR. Tell us; what end to his miseries awaits him?</p>

  <p>ELEC. Death, death; what else can? for he has no appetite for
  food.</p>

  <p>CHOR. Death then is manifestly before him.</p>

  <p>ELEC. Ph&#339;bus offered us as victims, when he commanded<a
  name="Orest_4"></a><a href="#OrestN_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> the dreadful,
  abhorred murder of our mother, that slew our father.</p>

  <p>CHOR. With justice indeed, but not well.</p>

  <p>ELEC. Thou hast died, thou hast died, O mother, O thou that didst
  bring me forth, but hast killed the father, and the children of thy
  blood. We perish, we perish, even as two corses. For thou art among the
  dead, and the greatest part of my life is passed in groans, and wailings,
  and nightly tears; marriageless, childless, behold, how like a miserable
  wretch do I drag out my existence forever!</p>

  <p>CHOR. O virgin Electra, approach near, and look that thy brother has
  not died unobserved by thee; for by this excessive quiet he doth not
  please me.</p>

<p class="center">ORESTES, ELECTRA, CHORUS.</p>

  <p>ORES. O precious balm of sleep, thou that relievest my malady, how
  pleasant didst thou come to me in the time of need! O divine oblivion of
  my sufferings, how wise thou art, and the goddess to be supplicated by
  all in distress!&mdash;whence, in heaven's name, came I hither? and how
  brought? for I remember not things past, bereaved, as I am, of my
  senses.</p>

  <p>ELEC. My dearest brother, how didst thou delight me when thou didst
  fall asleep! wilt thou I touch thee, and raise thy body up?</p>

  <p>ORES. Raise me then, raise me, and wipe the clotted foam from off my
  wretched mouth, and from my eyes.</p>

  <p>ELEC. Behold, the task is sweet, and I refuse not to administer to a
  brother's limbs with a sister's hand.</p>

  <p>ORES. Lay thy side by my side, and remove the squalid hair from my
  face, for I see but imperfectly with my eyes.</p>

  <p>ELEC. O wretched head, sordid with ringlets, how art thou disordered
  from long want of the bath!</p>

  <p>ORES. Lay me on the couch again; when my fit of madness gives me a
  respite, I am feeble and weak in my limbs.</p>

  <p>ELEC. Behold, the couch is pleasant to the sick man, an irksome thing
  to keep, but still a necessary one.</p>

  <p>ORES. Again raise me upright&mdash;turn my body.</p>

  <p>CHOR. Sick persons are hard to be pleased from their feebleness.</p>

  <p>ELEC. Wilt thou set thy feet on the ground, putting forward thy
  long-discontinued<a name="Orest_5"></a><a
  href="#OrestN_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> step? In all things change is
  sweet.</p>

  <p>ORES. Yes, by all means; for this has a semblance of health, but the
  semblance is good, though it be distant from the truth.</p>

  <p>ELEC. Hear now therefore, O my brother, while yet the Furies suffer
  thee to have thy right faculties.</p>

  <p>ORES. Wilt thou tell any news? and if good indeed, thou art conferring
  pleasure; but if it pertain at all to mischief&mdash;I have enough
  distress.</p>

  <p>ELEC. Menelaus has arrived, the brother of thy father, but his ships
  are moored in the Nauplian bay.</p>

  <p>ORES. How sayest? Is he come, a light in mine and thy sufferings, a
  man of kindred blood, and that hath received benefits from our
  father?</p>

  <p>ELEC. He is come; take this a sure proof of my words, bringing with
  him Helen from the walls of Troy.</p>

  <p>ORES. Had he been saved alone, he had been more blest. But if he
  brings his wife, he has arrived with a mighty evil.</p>

  <p>ELEC. Tyndarus begat an offspring of daughters, a conspicuous mark for
  blame, and infamous throughout Greece.</p>

  <p>ORES. Do thou then be unlike the bad, for it is in thy power. And not
  only say, but also hold these sentiments.</p>

  <p>ELEC. Alas! my brother, thine eye rolls wildly; quick art thou changed
  to madness, so late in thy senses.</p>

  <p>ORES. O mother, I implore thee, urge not on me those Furies gazing
  blood, horrid with snakes, for these, these are leaping around me.</p>

  <p>ELEC. Remain, O wretched man, calmly on thy couch, for thou seest none
  of those things, which thou fanciest thou seest plainly.</p>

  <p>ORES. O Ph&#339;bus, these dire Goddesses in the shape of dogs will
  kill me, these gorgon-visaged ministers of hell.</p>

  <p>ELEC. I will not let thee go, but, putting my arm around thee, will
  stop thy starting into those unfortunate convulsions.</p>

  <p>ORES. Loose me. Thou art one of my Furies, and seizest me by the
  middle, that thou mayest hurl me into Tartarus.</p>

  <p>ELEC. Oh! wretched me! what assistance can I obtain, since we have on
  us the vengeful wrath of heaven!</p>

  <p>ORES. Give me my bow of horn, the gift of Ph&#339;bus, with which
  Apollo said I should repel the Fiends, if they appalled me by their
  maddened raging.</p>

  <p>ELEC. Shall any God be wounded by mortal hand? (Note <a
  name="Orest_B"></a><a href="#OrestN_B">[B]</a>.)</p>

  <p>ORES. <i>Yes. She shall,</i> if she will not depart from my sight...
  Hear ye not&mdash;see ye not the winged shafts impelled from the
  distant-wounding bow? Ha! ha! Why tarry ye yet? Skim the high air with
  your wings, and impeach the oracles of Ph&#339;bus.&mdash;Ah! why am I
  thus disquieted, heaving my panting breath from my lungs? Whither,
  whither have I wandered from my couch? For from the waves again I see a
  calm.&mdash;Sister, why weepest, hiding thine eyes beneath thy vests, I
  am ashamed to have thee a partner in my sufferings, and to give a virgin
  trouble through my malady. Pine not away on account of my miseries: for
  thou indeed didst assent to this, but the shedding of my mother's blood
  was accomplished by me: but I blame Apollo, who, after having instigated
  me to a most unholy act, with words indeed consoled me, but not with
  deeds. But I think that my father, had I, beholding him, asked him if it
  were right for me to slay my mother, would have put forth many
  supplications, beseeching me by this beard not to impel my sword to the
  slaughter of her who bore me, if neither he thereby could be restored to
  life, and I thus wretched must go through such miseries. And now then
  unveil thyself, my sister, and cease from tears, even though we be very
  miserable: but when thou seest me desponding, do thou restrain my
  distraction, and that which preys upon my mind, and console me; but when
  thou groanest, it becomes my duty to come to thee, and suggest words of
  comfort. For these are the good offices friends ought to render each
  other. But go thou into the house, O unfortunate sister, and, stretched
  at full length, compose thy sleepless eyelids to sleep, and take
  refreshment, and pour the bath upon thy fair skin. For if thou forsakest
  me, or gettest any illness by continually sitting by me, we perish; for
  thee I have my only succor, by the rest, as thou seest, abandoned.</p>

  <p>ELEC. This can not be: with thee will I choose to die, with thee to
  live; for it is the same: for if then shouldst die, what can I do, a
  woman? how shall I be preserved, alone and destitute? without a brother,
  without a father, without a friend: but if it seemeth good to thee, these
  things it is my duty to do: but recline thy body on the bed, and do not
  to such a degree conceive to be real whatever frightens and startles thee
  from the couch, but keep quiet on the bed strewn for thee. For though
  thou be not ill, but only seem to be ill, still this even is an evil and
  a distress to mortals. (Note <a name="Orest_C"></a><a

  <p>CHORUS. Alas! alas! O swift-winged, raving<a name="Orest_6"></a><a
  href="#OrestN_6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> Goddesses, who keep up the dance, not
  that of Bacchus, with tears and groans. You, dark Eumenides, you, that
  fly through the wide extended air, executing vengeance, executing
  slaughter, you do I supplicate, I supplicate: suffer the offspring of
  Agamemnon to forget his furious madness; alas! for his sufferings. What
  were they that eagerly grasping at, thou unhappy perishest, having
  received from the tripod the oracle which Ph&#339;bus spake, on that
  pavement, where are said to be the recesses in the midst of the globe! O
  Jupiter, what pity is there? what is this contention of slaughter that
  comes persecuting thee wretched, to whom some evil genius casts tear upon
  tear, transporting to thy house the blood of thy mother which drives thee
  frenzied! Thus I bewail, I bewail. Great prosperity is not lasting among
  mortals; but, as the sail of the swift bark, some deity having shaken
  him, hath sunk him in the voracious and destructive waves of tremendous
  evils, as in the waves of the ocean. For what other<a
  name="Orest_6a"></a><a href="#OrestN_6a"><sup>[6a]</sup></a> family ought
  I to reverence yet before that sprung from divine nuptials, sprung from
  Tantalus?&mdash;But lo! the king! the prince Menelaus, is coming! but he
  is very easily discernible from the elegance of his person, as king of
  the house of the Tantalidæ.</p>

  <p>O thou that didst direct the army of a thousand vessels to Asia's
  land, hail! but thou comest hither with good fortune, having obtained the
  object of thy wishes from the Gods.</p>

<p class="center">MENELAUS, ORESTES, CHORUS.</p>

  <p>MEN. O palace, in some respect indeed I behold thee with pleasure,
  coming from Troy, but in other respect I groan when I see thee. For never
  yet saw I any other house more completely encircled round with lamentable
  woes. For I was made acquainted with the misfortune that befell
  Agamemnon, [and his death, by what death he perished at the hands of his
  wife,]<a name="Orest_6b"></a><a href="#OrestN_6b"><sup>[6b]</sup></a>
  when I was landing my ships at Malea; but from the waves the prophet of
  the mariners declared unto me, the foreboding Glaucus the son of Nereus,
  an unerring God, who told me thus in evident form standing by me.
  "Menelaus, thy brother lieth dead, having fallen in his last bath, which
  his wife prepared." But he filled both me and my sailors with many tears;
  but when I come to the Nauplian shore, my wife having already landed
  there, expecting to clasp in my friendly embraces Orestes the son of
  Agamemnon, and his mother, as being in prosperity, I heard from some
  fisherman<a name="Orest_7"></a><a href="#OrestN_7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> the
  unhallowed murder of the daughter of Tyndarus. And now tell me, maidens,
  where is the son of Agamemnon, who dared these terrible deeds of evil?
  for he was an infant in Clytæmnestra's arms at that time when I left the
  palace on my way to Troy, so that I should not know him, were I to see
  him.</p>

  <p>ORES. I, Menelaus, am Orestes, whom thou seekest, I of my own accord
  will declare my evils. But first I touch thy knees in supplication,
  putting up prayers from my mouth, not using the sacred branch:<a
  name="Orest_8"></a><a href="#OrestN_8"><sup>[8]</sup></a> save me. But
  thou art come in the very season of my sufferings.</p>

  <p>MEN. O ye Gods, what do I behold! whom of the dead do I see!</p>

  <p>ORES. Ay! well thou sayest the dead; for in my state of suffering I
  live not; but see the light.</p>

  <p>MEN. Thou wretched man, how disordered thou art in thy squalid
  hair!</p>

  <p>ORES. Not the appearance, but the deeds torment me.</p>

  <p>MEN. But thou glarest dreadfully with thy shriveled eyeballs.</p>

  <p>ORES. My body is vanished, but my name has not left me.</p>

  <p>MEN. Alas, thy uncomeliness of form which has appeared to me beyond
  conception!</p>

  <p>ORES. I am he, the murderer of my wretched mother.</p>

  <p>MEN. I have heard; but spare a little the recital of thy woes.</p>

  <p>ORES. I spare it; but in woes the deity is rich to me.</p>

  <p>MEN. What dost thou suffer? What malady destroys thee?</p>

  <p>ORES. The conviction that I am conscious of having perpetrated
  dreadful deeds.</p>

  <p>MEN. How sayest thou? Plainness, and not obscurity, is wisdom.</p>

  <p>ORES. Sorrow is chiefly what destroys me,&mdash;</p>

  <p>MEN. She is a dreadful goddess, but sorrow admits of cure.</p>

  <p>ORES. And fits of madness in revenge for my mother's blood.</p>

  <p>MEN. But when didst first have the raging? what day was it then?</p>

  <p>ORES. That day in which I heaped the tomb on my mother.</p>

  <p>MEN. What? in the house, or sitting at the pyre?</p>

  <p>ORES. As I was guarding by night lest any one should bear off her
  bones.<a name="Orest_9"></a><a href="#OrestN_9"><sup>[9]</sup></a></p>

  <p>MEN. Was any one else present, who supported thy body?</p>

  <p>ORES. Pylades, who perpetrated with me the vengeance and death of my
  mother.</p>

  <p>MEN. But by what visions art thou thus afflicted?</p>

  <p>ORES. I appear to behold three virgins like the night.</p>

  <p>MEN. I know whom thou meanest, but am unwilling to name them.</p>

  <p>ORES. Yes: for they are awful; but forbear from speaking such high
  polished words.<a name="Orest_10"></a><a
  href="#OrestN_10"><sup>[10]</sup></a></p>

  <p>MEN. Do these drive thee to distraction on account of this kindred
  murder?</p>

  <p>ORES. Alas me for the persecutions, with which wretched I am
  driven!</p>

  <p>MEN. It is not strange that those who do strange deeds should suffer
  them.</p>

  <p>ORES. But we have whereto we may transfer the criminality<a
  name="Orest_11"></a><a href="#OrestN_11"><sup>[11]</sup></a> of the
  mischance.</p>

  <p>MEN. Say not the death <i>of thy father;</i> for this is not wise.</p>

  <p>ORES. Ph&#339;bus who commanded us to perpetrate the slaying of our
  mother.</p>

  <p>MEN. Being more ignorant than to know equity, and justice.</p>

  <p>ORES. We are servants of the Gods, whatever those Gods be.</p>

  <p>MEN. And then does not Apollo assist thee in thy miseries?</p>

  <p>ORES. He is always about to do it, but such are the Gods by
  nature.</p>

  <p>MEN. But how long a time has thy mother's breath gone from her?</p>

  <p>ORES. This is the sixth day since; the funeral pyre is yet warm.</p>

  <p>MEN. How quickly have the Goddesses come to demand of thee thy
  mother's blood!</p>

  <p>ORES. I am not wise, but a true friend to my friends.</p>

  <p>MEN. But what then doth the revenge of thy father profit thee?</p>

  <p>ORES. Nothing yet; but I consider what is in prospect in the same
  light as a thing not done.</p>

  <p>MEN. But regarding the city how standest thou, having done these
  things?</p>

  <p>ORES. We are hated to that degree, that no one speaks to us.</p>

  <p>MEN. Nor hast thou washed thy blood from thy hands according to the
  laws?</p>

  <p>ORES. <i>How can I?</i> for I am shut out from the houses,
  whithersoever I go.</p>

  <p>MEN. Who of the citizens thus contend to drive thee from the land?</p>

  <p>ORES. &#338;ax,<a name="Orest_12"></a><a
  href="#OrestN_12"><sup>[12]</sup></a> imputing to my father the hatred
  which arose on account of Troy.</p>

  thee.</p>

  <p>ORES. In which at least I had no share&mdash;but I perish by the
  three.</p>

  <p>MEN. But who else? Is it perchance one of the friends of Ægisthus?</p>

  <p>ORES. They persecute me, whom now the city obeys.</p>

  <p>MEN. But does the city suffer thee to wield Agamemnon's sceptre?</p>

  <p>ORES. How should they? who no longer suffer us to live.</p>

  <p>MEN. Doing what, which thou canst tell me as a clear fact?</p>

  <p>ORES. This very day sentence will be passed upon us.</p>

  <p>MEN. To be exiled from this city? or to die? or not to die?</p>

  <p>ORES. To die, by being stoned with stones by the citizens.</p>

  <p>MEN. And dost thou not fly then, escaping beyond the boundaries of the
  country?</p>

  <p>ORES. <i>How can we?</i> for we are surrounded on every side by brazen
  arms.</p>

  <p>MEN. By private enemies, or by the hand of Argos?</p>

  <p>ORES. By all the citizens, that I may die&mdash;the word is brief.</p>

  <p>MEN. O unhappy man! thou art come to the extreme of misfortune.</p>

  <p>ORES. On thee my hope builds her escape from evils, but, thyself
  happy, coming among the distressed, impart thy good fortune to thy
  friends, and be not the only man to retain a benefit thou hast received,
  but undertake also services in thy turn, paying their father's kindness
  to those to whom thou oughtest. For those friends have the name, not the
  reality, who are not friends in adversity.</p>

  <p>CHOR. And see the Spartan Tyndarus is toiling hither with his aged
  foot, in a black vest, and shorn, his locks cut off in mourning for his
  daughter.</p>

  <p>ORES. I am undone, O Menelaus! Lo! Tyndarus is coming toward us, to
  come before whose presence, most of all men's, shame covereth me, on
  account of what has been done. For he used to nurture me when I was
  little, and satiated me with many kisses, dandling in his arms
  Agamemnon's boy, and Leda with him, honoring me no less than the
  twin-born of Jove. For which, O my wretched heart and soul, I have given
  no good return: what dark veil can I take for my countenance? what cloud
  can I place before me, that I may avoid the glances of the old man's
  eyes?</p>

<p class="center">TYNDARUS, MENELAUS, ORESTES, CHORUS.</p>

  <p>TYND. Where, where can I see my daughter's husband Menelaus? For as I
  was pouring my libations on the tomb of Clytæmnestra, I heard that he was
  come to Nauplia with his wife, safe through a length of years. Conduct
  me, for I long to stand by his hand and salute him, seeing my friend
  after a long lapse of time.</p>

  <p>MEN. O hail! old man, who sharest thy bed with Jove.</p>

  <p>TYND. O hail! thou also, Menelaus my dear relation,&mdash;ah! what an
  evil is it not to know the future! This dragon here, the murderer of his
  mother, glares before the house his pestilential gleams&mdash;the object
  of my detestation&mdash;Menelaus, dost thou speak to this unholy
  wretch?</p>

  <p>MEN. Why not? he is the son of a father who was dear to me.</p>

  <p>TYND. What! was he sprung from him, being such as he is?</p>

  <p>MEN. He was; but, though he be unfortunate, he should be
  respected.</p>

  <p>TYND. Having been a long time with barbarians, thou art thyself turned
  barbarian.</p>

  <p>MEN. Nay! it is the Grecian fashion always to honor one of kindred
  blood.</p>

  <p>TYND. <i>Yes</i>, and also not to wish to be above the laws.</p>

  <p>MEN. Every thing proceeding from necessity is considered as
  subservient to her<a name="Orest_13"></a><a
  href="#OrestN_13"><sup>[13]</sup></a> among the wise.</p>

  <p>TYND. Do thou then keep to this, but I'll have none of it.</p>

  <p>MEN. <i>No</i>, for anger joined with thine age, is not wisdom.</p>

  <p>TYND. With this man what controversy can there be regarding wisdom? If
  what things are virtuous, and what are not virtuous, are plain to all,
  what man was ever more unwise that this man? who did not indeed consider
  justice, nor applied to the common existing law of the Grecians. For
  after that Agamemnon breathed forth his last, struck by my daughter on
  the head, a most foul deed (for never will I approve of this), it
  behooved him indeed to lay against her a sacred charge of bloodshed,
  following up the accusation, and to cast his mother from out of the
  house; and he would have taken the wise side in the calamity, and would
  have kept to law, and would have been pious. But now has he come to the
  same fate with his mother. For with justice thinking her wicked, himself
  has become more wicked in slaying his mother.</p>

  <p>But thus much, Menelaus, will I ask thee; If the wife that shared his
  bed were to kill him, and his son again kills his mother in return, and
  he that is born of him shall expiate the murder with murder, whither then
  will the extremes of these evils proceed? Well did our fathers of old lay
  down these things; they suffered not him to come into the sight of their
  eyes, not to their converse, who was under an attainder<a
  name="Orest_14"></a><a href="#OrestN_14"><sup>[14]</sup></a> of blood;
  but they made him atone by banishment; they suffered however none to kill
  him in return. For always were one about to be attainted of murder,
  taking the pollution last into his hands. But I hate indeed impious
  women, but first among them my daughter, who slew her husband. But never
  will I approve of Helen thy wife, nor would I speak to her, neither do I
  commend<a name="Orest_15"></a><a href="#OrestN_15"><sup>[15]</sup></a>
  thee for going to the plain of Troy on account of a perfidious woman. But
  I will defend the law, as far at least as I am able, putting a stop to
  this brutish and murderous practice, which is ever destructive both of
  the country and the state.&mdash;For what feelings of humanity hadst
  thou, thou wretched man, when she bared her breast in supplication, thy
  mother? I indeed, though I witnessed not that scene of misery, melt in my
  aged eyes with tears through wretchedness. One thing however goes to the
  scale of my arguments; thou art both hated by the Gods, and sufferest
  vengeance of thy mother, wandering about with madness and terrors; why
  must I hear by the testimony of others, what it is in my power to see?
  That thou mayest know then <i>once for all</i>, Menelaus, do not things
  contrary to the Gods, through thy wishes to assist this man. But suffer
  him to be slain by the citizens with stones, or set not thy foot on
  Spartan ground. But my daughter in dying met with justice, but it was not
  fitting that she should die by him.<a name="Orest_16"></a><a
  href="#OrestN_16"><sup>[16]</sup></a> In other respects indeed have I
  been a happy man, except in my daughters, but in this I am not happy.</p>

  <p>CHOR. He is enviable, who is fortunate in his children, and has not on
  him some notorious calamities.</p>

  <p>ORES. O old man, I tremble to speak to thee, wherein I am about to
  grieve thee and thy mind. But I am unholy in that I slew my mother; but
  holy at least in another point of view, having avenged my father. Let
  then thine age, which hinders me through fear from speaking, be removed
  out of the way of my words, and I will go on in a direct path; but now do
  I fear thy gray hairs. What could I do? for oppose the facts, two against
  two. My father indeed begat me, but thy daughter brought me forth, a
  field receiving the seed from another; but without a father there never
  could be a child. I reasoned therefore with myself, that I should assist
  the prime author of my birth rather than the aliment which under him
  produced me. But thy daughter (I am ashamed to call her mother), in
  secret and unchaste nuptials, had approached the bed of another man; of
  myself, if I speak ill of her, shall I be speaking, but yet will I tell
  it. Ægisthus was her secret husband in her palace. Him I slew, and after
  him I sacrificed my mother, doing indeed unholy things, but avenging my
  father. But as touching those things for which thou threatenest that I
  must be stoned, hear, how I shall assist all Greece. For if the women
  shall arrive at such a pitch of boldness as to murder the men, making
  good their escape with regard to their children, seeking to captivate
  their pity by their breasts, it would be as nothing with them to slay
  their husbands, having any pretext that might chance; but I having done
  dreadful things (as thou sayest), have put a stop to this law, but hating
  my mother deservedly I slew her, who betrayed her husband absent from
  home in arms, the generalissimo of the whole land of Greece, and kept not
  her bed undefiled. But when she perceived that she had done amiss, she
  inflicted not vengeance on herself, but, that she might not suffer
  vengeance from her husband, punished and slew my father. By the Gods, (in
  no good cause have I named the Gods, pleading against a charge of
  murder,) had I by my silence praised my mother's actions, what then would
  the deceased have done to me? To my mother indeed the Furies are present
  as allies, but would they not be present to him, who has received the
  greater injury? Would he not, detesting me, have haunted me with the
  Furies? Thou then, O old man, by begetting a bad daughter, hast destroyed
  me; for through her boldness deprived of my father, I became a matricide.
  Dost see? Telemachus slew not the wife of Ulysses, for she married not a
  husband on a husband, but her marriage-bed remains unpolluted in the
  palace. Dost see? Apollo, who, dwelling in his habitation in the midst of
  the earth, gives the most clear oracles to mortals, by whom we are
  entirely guided, whatever he may say, on him relying slew I my mother.
  'Twas he who erred, not I: what could I do? Is not the God sufficient for
  me, who transfer <i>the deed</i> to him, to do away with the pollution?
  Whither then can any fly for succor, unless he that commanded me shall
  deliver me from death? But say not these things have been done "not
  well;" but <i>say</i> "not fortunately" for us who did them. But to
  whatsoever men their marriages are well established, there is a happy
  life, but to those to whom they fall not out well, with regard to their
  affairs both at home and abroad they are unfortunate.</p>

  <p>CHOR. Women were born always to be in the way of what may happen to
  men, to the making of things unfortunate.</p>

  <p>TYND. Since thou art bold, and yieldest not to my speech, but thus
  answerest me so as to grieve my mind, thou wilt rather inflame me to urge
  thy death. But this I shall consider a handsome addition to those labors
  for which I came, <i>namely</i>, to deck my daughter's tomb. For going to
  the multitude of the Argives assembled, I will rouse the state willing
  and not unwilling, to pass the sentence<a name="Orest_16a"></a><a
  href="#OrestN_16a"><sup>[16a]</sup></a> of being stoned on thee and on
  thy sister; but she is worthy of death rather than thee, who irritated
  thee against her mother, always pealing in thine ear words to increase
  thy hatred, relating dreams she had of Agamemnon, and this also, that the
  infernal Gods detested the bed of Ægisthus; for even here <i>on earth</i>
  it were hard <i>to be endured</i>; until she set the house in flames with
  fire more strong than Vulcan's.&mdash;Menelaus, but to thee I speak this,
  and will moreover perform it. If thou regard my hate, and my alliance,
  ward not off death from this man in opposition to the Gods; but suffer
  him to be slain by the citizens with stones, or set not thy foot on
  Spartan ground. Thus much having heard, depart, nor choose the impious
  for thy friends, passing over the pious.&mdash;But O attendants, conduct
  us from this house.</p>

  <p>ORES. Depart, that the remainder of my speech may reach this man
  uninterrupted by the clamors of thy age: Menelaus, whither dost thou roam
  in thought, entering on a double path of double care?</p>

  <p>MEN. Suffer me; having some thoughts with myself, I am perplexed to
  which side of fortune to turn me.</p>

  <p>ORES. Do not make up thy opinion, but having first heard my words,
  then deliberate.</p>

  <p>MEN. Say on; for thou hast spoken rightly; but there are seasons where
  silence may be better than talking, and there are seasons where talking
  may be better than silence.</p>

  <p>ORES. I will speak then forthwith: Long speeches have the preference
  before short ones, and are more plain to hear. Give thou to me nothing of
  what thou hast, O Menelaus, but what thou hast received from my father,
  return; I mean not riches&mdash;yet riches, which are the most dear of
  what I possess, if thou wilt preserve my life. Say I am unjust, I ought
  to receive from thee, instead of this evil, something contrary to what
  justice demands; for Agamemnon my father having collected Greece in arms,
  in a way justice did not demand, went to Troy, not having erred himself,
  but in order to set right the error, and injustice of thy wife. This one
  thing indeed thou oughtest to give me for one thing, but he, as friends
  should for friends, of a truth exposed his person for thee toiling at the
  shield, that thou mightest receive back thy wife. Repay me then this
  kindness for that which thou receivedst there, toiling for one day in
  standing as my succor, not completing ten years. But the sacrifice of my
  sister, which Aulis received, this I suffer thee to have; do not kill
  Hermione, <i>I ask it not</i>. For, I being in the state in which I now
  am, thou must of necessity have the advantage, and I must suffer it to be
  so. But grant my life to my wretched father, and my sister's, who has
  been a virgin a long time. For dying I shall leave my father's house
  destitute. Thou wilt say "impossible:" this is the very thing <i>I have
  been urging</i>, it behooves friends to help their friends in
  misfortunes. But when the God gives prosperity, what need is there of
  friends? For the God himself sufficeth, being willing to assist. Thou
  appearest to all the Greeks to be fond of thy wife; (and this I say, not
  stealing under thee imperceptibly with flattery;) by her I implore thee;
  O wretched me for my woes, to what have I come? but why must I suffer
  thus? For in behalf of the whole house I make this supplication. O divine
  brother of my father, conceive that the dead man beneath the earth hears
  these things, and that his spirit is hovering over thee, and speaks what
  I speak. These things have I said, with tears, and groans, and
  miseries,<a name="Orest_17"></a><a href="#OrestN_17"><sup>[17]</sup></a>
  and have prayed earnestly, looking for preservation, which all, and not I
  only, seek.</p>

  <p>CHOR. I too implore thee, although a woman, yet still I implore thee
  to succor those in need, but thou art able.</p>

  <p>MEN. Orestes, I indeed reverence thy person, and I am willing to labor
  with thee in thy misfortunes. For thus it is right to endure together the
  misfortunes of one's relations, if the God gives the ability, even so far
  as to die, and to kill the adversary; but this ability again I want from
  the Gods. For I am come having my single spear unaided by allies, having
  wandered with infinite labors with small assistance of friends left me.
  In battle therefore we can not come off superior to Pelasgian Argos; but
  if we can by soft speeches, to that hope are we equal. For how can any
  one achieve great actions with small means? For when the rabble is in
  full force falling into a rage, it is equally difficult to extinguish as
  a fierce fire. But if one quietly yields to it as it is spreading, and
  gives in to it, watching well his opportunity, perhaps it may spend its
  rage, but when it has remitted from its blast, you may without difficulty
  have it your own way, as much as you please. For there is inherent in
  them pity, but there is inherent also vehement passion, to one who
  carefully watches his opportunity a most excellent advantage. But I will
  go and endeavor to persuade Tyndarus, and the city, to use their great
  power in a becoming manner. For a ship, the main sheet stretched out to a
  violent degree, is wont to pitch, but stands upright again, if you
  slacken the main sheet. For the God hates too great vehemence, and the
  citizens hate it; but I must (I speak as I mean) save thee by wisdom, not
  by opposing my superiors. But I can not by force, as perchance thou
  thinkest, preserve thee; for it is no easy matter to erect from one
  single spear trophies from the evils, which are about thee. For never
  have we approached the land of Argos by way of supplication; but now
  there is necessity for the wise to become the slaves of fortune.</p>

<p class="center">ORESTES, CHORUS.</p>

  <p>ORES. O thou, a mere cipher in other things except in warring for the
  sake of a woman; O thou most base in avenging thy friends, dost thou fly,
  turning away from me? But all Agamemnon's services are gone: thou wert
  then without friends, O my father, in thy affliction. Alas me! I am
  betrayed, and there no longer are any hopes, whither turning I may escape
  death from the Argives. For he was the refuge of my safety. But I see
  this most dear of men, Pylades, coming with hasty step from the Phocians,
  a pleasing sight, a man faithful in adversity, more grateful to behold
  than the calm to the mariners.</p>

<p class="center">PYLADES, ORESTES, CHORUS.</p>

  <p>PYL. I came through the city with a quicker step than I ought, having
  heard of the council of state assembled, and seeing it plainly myself,
  against thee and thy sister, as about to kill you instantly.&mdash;What
  is this? how art thou? in what state, O most dear to me of my companions
  and kindred? for all these things art thou to me.</p>

  <p>ORES. We are gone&mdash;briefly to show thee my calamities.</p>

  <p>PYL. Thou wilt have ruined me too; for the things of friends are
  common.</p>

  <p>ORES. Menelaus has behaved most basely toward me and my sister.</p>

  <p>PYL. It is to be expected that the husband of a bad wife be bad.</p>

  <p>ORES. He is come, and has done just as much for me as if he had not
  come.</p>

  <p>PYL. What! is he in truth come to this land?</p>

  <p>ORES. After a long season; but nevertheless he was very soon
  discovered to be too base to his friends.</p>

  <p>PYL. And has he brought in his ship with him his most infamous
  wife?</p>

  <p>ORES. Not he her, but she brought him hither.</p>

  <p>PYL. Where is she, who, beyond any woman,<a name="Orest_18"></a><a
  href="#OrestN_18"><sup>[18]</sup></a> destroyed most of the Grecians?</p>

  <p>ORES. In my palace, if I may indeed be allowed to call this mine.</p>

  <p>PYL. But what words didst thou say to thy father's brother?</p>

  <p>ORES. <i>I requested him</i> not to suffer me and my sister to be
  slain by the citizens.</p>

  <p>PYL. By the Gods, what said he to this request; this I wish to
  know.</p>

  <p>ORES. He declined, from motives of prudence, as bad friends act toward
  their friends.</p>

  <p>PYL. Going on what ground of excuse? This having learned, I am in
  possession of every thing.</p>

  <p>ORES. The father himself came, he that begat such excellent
  daughters.</p>

  <p>PYL. Tyndarus you mean; perhaps enraged with thee on account of his
  daughter.</p>

  <p>ORES. You are right: be paid more attention to his ties with him, than
  to his ties with my father.</p>

  <p>PYL. And dared he not, being present, to take arms against thy
  troubles?</p>

  <p>ORES. <i>No</i>: for he was not born a warrior, but brave among
  women.</p>

  <p>PYL. Thou art then in the greatest miseries, and it is necessary for
  thee to die.</p>

  <p>ORES. The citizens must pass their vote on us for the murder <i>we
  have committed</i>.<a name="Orest_19"></a><a
  href="#OrestN_19"><sup>[19]</sup></a></p>

  <p>PYL. Which vote what will it decide? tell me, for I am in fear.</p>

  <p>ORES. Either to die or live; not many words on matters of great
  import.</p>

  <p>PYL. Come fly, and quit the palace with thy sister.</p>

  <p>ORES. Seest thou not? we are watched by guards on every side,</p>

  <p>PYL. I saw the streets of the city lined with arms.</p>

  <p>ORES. We are invested as to our persons, as a city by the enemy.</p>

  <p>PYL. Now ask me also, what I suffer; for I too am undone.</p>

  <p>ORES. By whom? This would be an evil added to my evils.</p>

  <p>PYL. Strophius, my father, being enraged, hath driven me an exile from
  his house.</p>

  <p>ORES. Bringing against thee some private charge, or one in common with
  the citizens?</p>

  <p>PYL. Because I perpetrated with thee the murder of thy mother, he
  banished me, calling me unholy.</p>

  <p>ORES. O thou unfortunate! it seems that thou also sufferest for my
  evils.</p>

  <p>PYL. We have not Menelaus's manners&mdash;this must be borne.</p>

  <p>ORES. Dost thou not fear lest Argos should wish to kill thee, as it
  does also me?</p>

  <p>PYL. We do not belong to these to punish, but to the land of the
  Phocians.</p>

  <p>ORES. The populace is a terrible thing, when they have evil
  leaders.</p>

  <p>PYL. But when they have good ones, they always deliberate good
  things.</p>

  <p>ORES. Be it so: we must speak on our common business.</p>

  <p>PYL. On what affair of necessity?</p>

  <p>ORES. Supposing I should go to the citizens, and say&mdash;</p>

  <p>PYL. &mdash;that thou hast acted justly?</p>

  <p>ORES. Ay, avenging my father:</p>

  <p>PYL. I fear they might not receive thee gladly.</p>

  <p>ORES. But shall I die then shuddering in silence!</p>

  <p>PYL. This were cowardly.</p>

  <p>ORES. How then can I do?</p>

  <p>PYL. Hast thou any chance of safety, if thou remainest?</p>

  <p>ORES. I have none.</p>

  <p>PYL. But going, is there any hope of thy being preserved from thy
  miseries?</p>

  <p>ORES. Should it chance well, there might be.</p>

  <p>PYL. Is not this then better than remaining?</p>

  <p>ORES. Shall I go then?</p>

  <p>PYL. Dying thus, at least thou wilt die more honorably.</p>

  <p>ORES. And I have a just cause.</p>

  <p>PYL. Only pray for its appearing so.</p>

  <p>ORES. Thou sayest well: this way I avoid the imputation of
  cowardice.</p>

  <p>PYL. More than by tarrying here.</p>

  <p>ORES. And some one perchance may pity me&mdash;</p>

  <p>PYL. Yes; for thy nobleness of birth is a great thing.</p>

  <p>ORES. &mdash;indignant at my father's death.</p>

  <p>PYL. All this in prospect.</p>

  <p>ORES. Go I must, for it is not manly to die ingloriously.</p>

  <p>PYL. These sentiments I praise.</p>

  <p>ORES. Shall we then tell these things to my sister?</p>

  <p>PYL. No, by the Gods.</p>

  <p>ORES. Why, there might be tears.</p>

  <p>PYL. This then is a great omen.</p>

  <p>ORES. Clearly it is better to be silent.</p>

  <p>PYL. Thou art a gainer by delay.</p>

  <p>ORES. This one thing only opposes me.</p>

  <p>PYL. What new thing again is this thou sayest?</p>

  <p>ORES. I fear lest the goddesses should stop me with their
  torments.</p>

  <p>PYL. But I will take care of thee.</p>

  <p>ORES. It is a difficult and dangerous task to touch a man thus
  disordered.</p>

  <p>PYL. Not for me to touch thee.</p>

  <p>ORES. Take care how thou art partner of my madness.</p>

  <p>PYL. Let not this be thought of.</p>

  <p>ORES. Wilt thou not then be timid to assist me?</p>

  <p>PYL. No, for timidity is a great evil to friends.</p>

  <p>ORES. Go on now, the helm of my foot.</p>

  <p>PYL. Having a charge worthy of a friend.</p>

  <p>ORES. And guide me to my father's tomb.</p>

  <p>PYL. To what end is this?</p>

  <p>ORES. That I may supplicate him to save me.</p>

  <p>PYL. This at least is just.</p>

  <p>ORES. But let me not see my mother's monument.</p>

  <p>PYL. For she was an enemy. But hasten, that the decree of the Argives
  condemn thee not before thou goest; leaning thy side, weary with disease,
  on mine: since I will conduct thee through the city, little caring for
  the multitude, nothing ashamed; for where shall I show myself thy friend,
  if I assist thee not when them art in perilous condition?</p>

  <p>ORES. This it is to have companions, not relationship alone; so that a
  man who is congenial in manners, though a stranger in blood, is a better
  friend for a man to have, than ten thousand relatives.</p>

<p class="center">CHORUS.</p>

  <p>The great happiness, and the valor high sounding throughout Greece,
  and by the channels of the Simois, has again withdrawn from the fortune
  of the Atridæ, as of old, from the ancient calamity of the house, when
  the strife of the golden lamb<a name="Orest_20"></a><a
  href="#OrestN_20"><sup>[20]</sup></a> arose among the descendants of
  Tantalus; most shocking feasts, and the slaughter of noble children; from
  whence murder responsive to murder fails not to attend on the two sons of
  Atreus. What seems good is not good, to gash the parents' skin with a
  fierce hand, and brandish the sword black-stained with blood in the
  sunbeams. But, on the other hand, to act wickedly<a
  name="Orest_21"></a><a href="#OrestN_21"><sup>[21]</sup></a> is mad
  impiety, and the folly of evil-minded men.</p>

  <p>But the wretched daughter of Tyndarus in the fear of death shrieked
  out, "My son, thou darest impious deeds, killing thy mother; do not,
  attending to the gratification of thy father, kindle an everlasting
  disgrace."</p>

  <p>What malady, or what tears, or what pity on earth is greater, than to
  imbrue one's hand in a mother's blood? What a deed, what a deed having
  performed, does the son of Agamemnon rave with madness, a prey to the
  Eumenides, marked for death, giddy with his rolling eyes! O wretched on
  account of his mother, when though seeing the breast bared from the robe
  of golden texture, he stabbed the mother in retaliation for the father's
  sufferings.</p>

<p class="center">ELECTRA, CHORUS.</p>

  <p>ELEC. Ye virgins, has the wretched Orestes, overcome with
  heaven-inflicted madness, rushed any where from this house?</p>

  <p>CHOR. By no means; but he is gone to the Argive people, to undergo the
  trial proposed regarding life, by which you must either live or die.</p>

  <p>ELEC. Alas me! what thing has he done? but who persuaded him?</p>

  <p>CHOR. Pylades.&mdash;But this messenger seems soon about to inform us
  of what has passed there concerning thy brother.</p>

<p class="center">MESSENGER, ELECTRA, CHORUS.</p>

  <p>MESS. O wretched hapless daughter of the chief Agamemnon, revered
  Electra, hear the unfortunate words which I am come to bring.</p>

  <p>ELEC. Alas! alas! we are undone; this thou signifiest by thy speech.
  For thou comest, as it seems, a messenger of woes.</p>

  <p>MESS. It has been carried by the vote of the Pelasgians, that thy
  brother and thou must die this day.</p>

  <p>ELEC. Ah me! the expected event has come, which long since fearing, I
  pined away with lamentations on account of what was in
  prospect.&mdash;But what was the debate? What arguments among the Argives
  condemned us, and confirmed our sentence of death? Tell me, old man,
  whether by the hand raised to stone me, or by the sword must I breathe
  out my soul, having this calamity in common with my brother?</p>

  <p>MESS. I chanced indeed to be entering the gates from the country,
  anxious to hear both what regarded thee, and what regarded Orestes; for
  at all times I had a favorable inclination toward thy father: and thy
  house fed me, poor indeed, but noble in my conduct toward friends. But I
  see the crowd going and sitting down on an eminence; where they say
  Danaus first collected the people to a common council, when he suffered
  punishment at the hands of Ægyptus. But seeing this concourse, I asked
  one of the citizens, "What new thing is stirring in Argos? Has any
  message from hostile powers roused the city of the Danaids?" But he said,
  "Seest thou not this Orestes walking near us, who is about to run in the
  contest of life and death?" But I see an unexpected sight, which oh that
  I had never seen! Pylades and thy brother walking together, the one
  indeed broken with sickness, but the other, like a brother, sympathizing
  with his friend, tending his weakened state with fostering care. But when
  the assembly of the Argives was full, a herald stood forth and said, "Who
  wishes to speak <i>on the question</i>, whether it is right that Orestes,
  who has killed his mother, should die, or not?" And on this Talthybius
  rises, who, in conjunction with thy father, laid waste the Phrygians. But
  he spoke words of divided import, being the constant slave of those in
  power; struck with admiration indeed at thy father, but not commending
  thy brother (speciously mixing up words of bad import), because he laid
  down no good laws toward his parents: but he was continually casting a
  smiling glance on Ægisthus's friends. For such is this kind; heralds
  always dance attendance on the prosperous; but that man is their friend,
  whoever may chance to have power in the state, and to be in office. But
  next to him prince Diomed harangued; he indeed was for suffering them to
  kill neither thee nor thy brother, but <i>bid them</i> observe piety by
  punishing you with banishment. But some indeed murmured their assent,
  that he spoke well, but others praised him not.<a name="Orest_22"></a><a
  href="#OrestN_22"><sup>[22]</sup></a> And after him rises up some man,
  intemperate in speech, powerful in boldness, an Argive, yet not an
  Argive,<a name="Orest_23"></a><a href="#OrestN_23"><sup>[23]</sup></a>
  forced upon us, relying both on the tumult, and on ignorant boldness,
  prompt by persuasion to involve them in some mischief. (For when a man,
  sweet in words, holding bad sentiments, persuades the multitude, it is a
  great evil to the city. But as many as always advise good things with
  understanding, although not at the present moment, eventually are of
  service to the state: but the intelligent leader ought to look to this,
  for the case is the same with the man who speaks words, and the man who
  approves them.) Who said, that they ought to kill Orestes and thee by
  stoning. But Tyndarus was privily making up such sort of speeches for him
  who wished your death to speak. But another man stood up, and spoke in
  opposition to him, in form indeed not made to catch the eye; but a man
  endued with the qualities of a man, rarely polluting the city, and the
  circle of the forum; one who farmed his own land,<a
  name="Orest_24"></a><a href="#OrestN_24"><sup>[24]</sup></a> which class
  of persons<a name="Orest_25"></a><a href="#OrestN_25"><sup>[25]</sup></a>
  alone preserve the country, but prudent, and wishing the tenor of his
  conduct to be in unison with his words, uncorrupted, one that had
  conformed to a blameless mode of living; he proposed to crown Orestes the
  son of Agamemnon,<a name="Orest_25a"></a><a
  href="#OrestN_25a"><sup>[25a]</sup></a> who was willing to avenge his
  father by slaying a wicked and unholy woman, who took this out of the
  power of men, and would no one have been the cause of arming the hand for
  war, nor undertaking an expedition, leaving his home, if those who are
  left destroy what is intrusted to their charge in the house, disgracing
  their husbands' beds. And to right-minded men at least he appeared to
  speak well: and none spoke besides, but thy brother advanced and said, "O
  inhabitants of the land of Inachus, avenging you no less than my father,
  I slew my mother, for if the murder of men shall become licensed to
  women, ye no longer can escape dying, or ye must be slaves to your wives.
  But ye do the contrary to what ye ought to do. For now she that was false
  to the bed of my father is dead; but if ye do indeed slay me, the law has
  lost its force, and no man can escape dying, forasmuch as there will be
  no lack of this audacity."</p>

  <p>But he persuaded not the people, though appearing to speak well. But
  that villain, who spoke among the multitude, overcomes him, he that
  harangued for the killing of thy brother and thee. But scarcely did the
  wretched Orestes persuade them that he might not die by stoning; but he
  promised that this day he would quit his life by self-slaughter together
  with thee:&mdash;but Pylades is conducting him from the council, weeping:
  but his friends accompany him bewailing him, pitying him; but he is
  coming a sad spectacle to thee, and a wretched sight. But prepare the
  sword, or the noose for thy neck, for thou must die, but thy nobleness of
  birth hath profited thee nothing, nor the Pythian Ph&#339;bus who sits on
  the tripod, but hath destroyed thee.</p>

  <p>CHOR. O unhappy virgin! how art thou dumb, casting thy muffled
  countenance toward the ground, as though about to run into a strain of
  groans and lamentations!</p>

  <p>ELEC. I begin the lament, O land of Greece, digging my white nail into
  my cheek, sad bleeding woe, and dashing my head, which<a

  name="Orest_27"></a><a href="#OrestN_27"><sup>[27]</sup></a> goddess of
  the manes beneath the earth has to her share. And let the Cyclopian
  land<a name="Orest_28"></a><a href="#OrestN_28"><sup>[28]</sup></a> howl,
  applying the steel to their head cropped of hair over the calamity of our
  house. This pity, this pity, proceeds for those who are about to die, who
  once were the princes of Greece. For it is gone, it is gone, the entire
  race of the children of Pelops has perished, and the happiness which once
  resided in these blest abodes. Envy from heaven has now seized it, and
  the harsh decree of blood in the state. Alas! alas! O race of mortals
  that endure for a day, full of tears, full of troubles, behold how
  contrary to expectation fate comes. But in the long lapse of time each
  different man receives by turns his different sufferings.<a

  <p>Oh! could I go to that rock stretched from Olympus in its loftiness
  midst heaven and earth by golden chains, that mass of clay borne round
  with rapid revolutions, that in my plaints I might cry out to my ancient
  father Tantalus; who begat the progenitors of my family, who saw
  calamities, what time in the pursuing of steeds, Pelops in his car drawn
  by four horses perpetrated, as he drove, the murder of Myrtilus, <i>by
  casting him</i> into the sea, hurling him down to the surge of the ocean,
  as he guided his car on the shore of the briny sea by Geræstus foaming
  with its white billows. Whence the baleful curse came on my house since,
  by the agency of Maia's son,<a name="Orest_30"></a><a

  pernicious prodigy of the golden-fleeced lamb, a birth which took place

  <p>CHOR. But see, thy brother is advancing, condemned by the vote of
  death, and Pylades the most faithful of all, a man like a brother,
  supporting the enfeebled limbs of Orestes, walking by his side<a

  foot of tender solicitude.</p>

<p class="center">ELECTRA, ORESTES, PYLADES, CHORUS.</p>

  <p>ELEC. Alas me! for I bewail thee, my brother, seeing thee before the
  tomb, and before the pyre of thy departed shade: alas me! again and
  again, how am I bereft of my senses, seeing with my eyes the very last
  sight of thee.</p>

  <p>ORES. Wilt thou not in silence, ceasing from womanish groans, make up
  thy mind to what is decreed? These things indeed are lamentable, but yet
  we must bear our present fate.</p>

  <p>ELEC. And how can I be silent? We wretched no longer are permitted to
  view this light of the God.</p>

  <p>ORES. Do not thou kill me; I, the unhappy, have died enough already
  under the hands of the Argives; but pass over our present ills.</p>

  <p>ELEC. O Orestes! oh wretched in thy youth, and thy fate, and thy
  untimely death, then oughtest thou to live, when thou art no more.</p>

  <p>ORES. Do not by the Gods throw cowardice around me, bringing the
  remembrance of my woes so as to cause tears.</p>

  <p>ELEC. We shall die; it is not possible not to groan our misfortunes;
  for the dear life is a cause of pity to all mortals.</p>

  <p>ORES. This is the day appointed for us! but we must either fit the
  suspended noose, or whet the sword with our hand.</p>

  <p>ELEC. Do thou then kill me, my brother; let none of the Argives kill
  me, putting a contumely on the offspring of Agamemnon.</p>

  <p>ORES. I have enough of thy mother's blood, but thee I will not slay;
  but die by thine own hand in whatever manner thou wilt.</p>

  <p>ELEC. These things shall be; I will not be deserted by thy sword;<a
  name="Orest_34"></a><a href="#OrestN_34"><sup>[34]</sup></a> but I wish
  to clasp my hands around thy neck.</p>

  <p>ORES. Thou enjoyest a vain gratification, if this be an enjoyment, to
  throw thy hands around those who are hard at death's door.</p>

  <p>ELEC. Oh thou most dear! oh thou that hast the desirable and most
  sweet name, and one soul with thy sister!</p>

  <p>ORES. Thou wilt melt me; and still I wish to answer thee in the
  endearment of encircling arms, for why am I any longer ashamed? O bosom
  of my sister, O dear object of my caresses, these embraces are allowed to
  us miserable beings instead of children and the bridal bed.</p>

  <p>ELEC. Alas! How can the same sword (if this request be lawful) kill
  us, and one tomb wrought of cedar receive us?</p>

  <p>ORES. This would be most sweet; but thou seest how destitute we are,
  in respect to being able to share our sepulture.</p>

  <p>ELEC. Did not Menelaus speak in behalf of thee, taking a decided part
  against thy death, the base man, the deserter of my father? [Note <a
  name="Orest_G"></a><a href="#OrestN_G">[G]</a>.]</p>

  <p>ORES. He showed it not even in his countenance, but keeping his hopes
  on the sceptre, he was cautious how he saved his friends. But let be, he
  will die acting in a manner nobly, and most worthily of Agamemnon. And I
  indeed will show my high descent to the city, striking home to my heart
  with the sword; but thee, on the other hand, it behooveth to act in
  concert with my bold attempts. But do thou, Pylades, be the umpire of our
  death, and well compose the bodies of us when dead, and bury us together,
  bearing us to our father's tomb. And farewell&mdash;but I am going to the
  deed, as thou seest.</p>

  <p>PYL. Hold. This one thing indeed first I bring in charge against
  thee&mdash;Dost thou think that I can wish to live when thou diest?<a
  name="Orest_35"></a><a href="#OrestN_35"><sup>[35]</sup></a></p>

  <p>ORES. For how does it concern thee to die with me?</p>

  <p>PYL. Dost ask? But how does it to live without thy company?</p>

  <p>ORES. Thou didst not slay my mother, as I did, a wretch.</p>

  <p>PYL. With thee I did at least; I ought also to suffer these things in
  common with thee.</p>

  <p>ORES. Take thyself back to thy father, do not die with me. For thou
  indeed hast a city (but I no longer have), and the mansion of thy father,
  and a great harbor of wealth. But thou art frustrated in thy marriage
  with this unhappy virgin, whom I betrothed to thee, revering thy
  friendship. Nevertheless do thou, contracting other nuptials, be a blest
  father, but the connection between me and thee no longer subsists, But
  thou, O darling name of my converse, farewell, be happy, for this is not
  allowed me, but it is to thee; for we, the dead, are deprived of
  happiness.</p>

  <p>PYL. Surely thou art wide astray from my purposes. Nor may the
  fruitful plain receive my blood, nor the bright air, if ever I betraying
  thee, having freed myself, forsake thee; for I committed the slaughter
  with thee (I will not deny it), and I planned all things, for which now
  thou sufferest vengeance. Die then I must with thee and her together, for
  her, whose marriage I have courted, I consider as my wife; for what good
  excuse ever shall I give, going to the Delphian land to the citadel of
  the Phocians, I, who was present with you, your friend, before indeed you
  were unfortunate, but now, when you are unfortunate, am no longer thy
  friend? It is not possible &mdash;but these things are my care also. But
  since we are about to die, let us come to a common conference, how
  Menelaus may be involved in our calamity.</p>

  <p>ORES. O thou dearest man: for would I see this and die.</p>

  <p>PYL. Be persuaded then, but defer the slaughtering sword.</p>

  <p>ORES. I will defer, if any how I can avenge myself on my enemy.</p>

  <p>PYL. Be silent then, for I have but small confidence in women.</p>

  <p>ORES. Do not at all fear these, for they are friends that are
  present.</p>

  <p>PYL. Let us kill Helen, which will cause great grief to Menelaus.</p>

  <p>ORES. How? for the will is here, if it can be done with glory.</p>

  <p>PYL. Stabbing her; but she is lurking in thy house.</p>

  <p>ORES. Yes indeed, and is putting her seal on all my effects.</p>

  <p>PYL. But she shall seal no more, having Pluto for her bridegroom.</p>

  <p>ORES. And how can this be? for she has a train of barbarian
  attendants.</p>

  <p>PYL. Whom? for I would be afraid of no Phrygian.</p>

  <p>ORES. Such men as should preside over mirrors and scents.</p>

  <p>PYL. For has she brought hither her Trojan fineries?</p>

  <p>ORES. <i>Oh yes!</i> so that Greece is but a cottage for her.</p>

  <p>PYL. A race of slaves is a mere nothing against a race that will not
  be slaves.</p>

  <p>ORES. In good truth, this if I could achieve, I shrink not from two
  deaths.</p>

  <p>PYL. But neither do I indeed, if I could revenge thee at least.</p>

  <p>ORES. Disclose thy purpose, and go through it as thou sayest.</p>

  <p>PYL. We will enter then the house, as men about to die.</p>

  <p>ORES. Thus far I comprehend, but the rest I do not comprehend.</p>

  <p>PYL. We will make our lamentation to her of the things we suffer.</p>

  <p>ORES. So that she shall weep, though joyed within her heart.</p>

  <p>PYL. And the same things will be for us to do afterward, which she
  does then.</p>

  <p>ORES. Then how shall we finish the contest?</p>

  <p>PYL. We will wear our swords concealed beneath our robes.</p>

  <p>ORES. But what slaughter can there be before her attendants?</p>

  <p>PYL. We will bolt them out, scattered in different parts of the
  house.</p>

  <p>ORES. And him that is not silent we must kill.</p>

  <p>PYL. Then the circumstances of the moment will point out what steps to
  take.</p>

  <p>ORES. To kill Helen, I understand the sign.</p>

  <p>PYL. Thou seest: but hear on what honorable principles I meditate it.
  For, if we draw our sword on a more modest woman, the murder will blot
  our names with infamy. But in the present instance, she shall suffer
  vengeance for the whole of Greece, whose fathers she slew, and made the
  brides bereaved of their spouses; there shall be a shout, and they will
  kindle up fire to the Gods, praying for many blessings to fall to thee
  and me, inasmuch as we shed the blood of a wicked woman. But thou shalt
  not be called the matricide, when thou hast slain her, but dropping this
  name thou shalt arrive at better things, being styled the slayer of the
  havoc-dealing Helen. It never, never were right that Menelaus should be
  prosperous, and that thy father, and thou, and thy sister should die, and
  thy mother; (this I forbear, for it is not decorous to mention;) and that
  he should seize thy house, having recovered his bride by the means of
  Agamemnon's valor. For may I live no longer, if I draw not my black sword
  upon her. But if then we do not compass the murder of Helen, having fired
  the palace we will die, for we shall have glory, succeeding in one of
  these two things, nobly dying, or nobly rescued.</p>

  <p>CHOR. The daughter of Tyndarus is an object of detestation to all
  women, being one that has given rise to scandal against the sex.</p>

  <p>ORES. Alas! There is no better thing than a real friend, not riches,
  not kingdoms; but the popular applause becomes a thing of no account to
  receive in exchange for a generous friend. For thou contrivedst the
  destruction that befell Ægisthus, and wast close to me in my dangers. But
  now again thou givest me to revenge me on mine enemies, and art not out
  of the way&mdash;but I will leave off praising thee, since there is some
  burden even in this "to be praised to excess." But I altogether in a
  state of death, wish to do something to my foes and die, that I may in
  turn destroy those who betrayed me, and those may groan who also made me
  unhappy. I am the son of Agamemnon, who ruled over Greece by general
  consent; no tyrant, but yet he had the power as it were of a God, whom I
  will not disgrace, suffering a slavish death, but breathe out my soul in
  freedom, but on Menelaus will I revenge me. For if we could gain this one
  thing, we should be prosperous, if from any chance safety should come
  unhoped for on the slayers <i>then</i>, not the slain: this I pray for.
  For what I wish is sweet to delight the mind without fear of cost, though
  with but fleeting words uttered through the mouth.</p>

  <p>ELEC. I, O brother, think that this very thing brings safety to thee,
  and thy friend, and in the third place to me.</p>

  <p>ORES. Thou meanest the providence of the Gods: but where is this? for
  I know that there is understanding in thy mind.</p>

  <p>ELEC. Hear me then, and thou too give thy attention.</p>

  <p>ORES. Speak, since the existing prospect of good affords some
  pleasure.</p>

  <p>ELEC. Art thou acquainted with the daughter of Helen? Thou knowest her
  of whom I ask.</p>

  <p>ORES. I know her, Hermione, whom my mother brought up.</p>

  <p>ELEC. She is gone to Clytæmnestra's tomb.</p>

  <p>ORES. For what purpose? what hope dost thou suggest?</p>

  <p>ELEC. To pour libations on the tomb in behalf of her mother.</p>

  <p>ORES. And what is this, thou hast told me of, that regards our
  safety?</p>

  <p>ELEC. Seize her as a pledge as she is coming back.</p>

  <p>ORES. What remedy for the three friends is this thou sayest?</p>

  <p>ELEC. When Helen is dead, if Menelaus does any harm to thee or
  Pylades, or me (for this firm of friendship is all one), say that thou
  wilt kill Hermione; but thou oughtest to draw thy sword, and hold it to
  the neck of the virgin. And if indeed Menelaus save thee, anxious that
  the virgin may not die; when he sees Helen's corse weltering in blood,
  give back the virgin for her father to enjoy; but should he, not
  governing his angry temper, slay thee, do thou also plunge the sword into
  the virgin's neck, and I think that he, though at first he come to us
  very big, will after a season soften his heart; for neither is he brave
  nor valiant: this is the fortress of our safety that I have; my arguments
  on the subject have been spoken.</p>

  <p>ORES. O thou that hast indeed the mind of a man, but a form among
  women beautiful, to what a degree art thou more worthy of life than
  death! Pylades, wilt thou miserably be disappointed of such a woman, or
  dwelling with her obtain this happy marriage?</p>

  <p>PYL. For would it could be so! and she could come to the city of the
  Phocians meeting with her deserts in splendid nuptials!</p>

  <p>ORES. But when will Hermione come to the house? Since for the rest
  thou saidst most admirably, if we could succeed in taking the whelp of
  the impious father.</p>

  <p>ELEC. Even now I guess that she must be near the house, for <i>with
  this supposition</i> the space itself of the time coincides.</p>

  <p>ORES. It is well; do thou therefore, my sister Electra, waiting before
  the house, meet the arrival of the virgin. And watch, lest any one,
  either some ally, or the brother of my father, should be beforehand with
  us coming to the palace: and make some noise toward the house, either
  knocking at the doors, or sending thy voice within. But let us, O Pylades
  (for thou undertakest this labor with me), entering in, arm our hands
  with the sword to one last attempt. O my father, that inhabitest the
  realms of gloomy night, Orestes thy son invokes thee to come a succor to
  thy suppliants; for on thy account I wretched suffer unjustly, and am
  betrayed by thy brother, myself having acted justly: whose wife I wish to
  take and destroy; but be thou our accomplice in this affair.</p>

  <p>ELEC. O father, come then, if beneath the earth thou hearest thy
  children calling, who die for thee.</p>

  <p>PYL. O thou relation<a name="Orest_36"></a><a
  href="#OrestN_36"><sup>[36]</sup></a> of my father, give ear, O
  Agamemnon, to my prayers also, preserve thy children.</p>

  <p>ORES. I slew my mother.</p>

  <p>PYL. But I directed the sword.</p>

  <p>ELEC. But I at least incited you, and freed you from delay.</p>

  <p>ORES. Succoring thee, my father.</p>

  <p>ELEC. Neither did I forsake thee.</p>

  <p>PYL. Wilt thou not therefore, hearing these things that are brought
  against thee,<a name="Orest_37"></a><a
  href="#OrestN_37"><sup>[37]</sup></a> defend thy children?</p>

  <p>ORES. I pour libations on thee with my tears.</p>

  <p>ELEC. And I with lamentations.</p>

  <p>PYL. Cease, and let us haste forth to the work, for if prayers
  penetrate under the earth, he hears; but, O Jove our ancestor, and thou
  revered deity of justice, grant us to succeed, him, and myself, and this
  virgin, for over us three friends one hazard, one cause impends, either
  for all to live, or all to die!</p>

<p class="center">ELECTRA, CHORUS.</p>

  <p>ELEC. O dear Mycenian virgins, who have the first place at the
  Pelasgian seat of the Argives;&mdash;</p>

  <p>CHOR. What voice art thou uttering, my respected mistress? for this
  appellation awaits thee in the city of the Danaids.</p>

  <p>ELEC. Arrange yourselves, some of you in this beaten way, and some
  there, in that other path, to guard the house.</p>

  <p>CHOR. But on what account dost thou command this, tell me, my
  friend.</p>

  <p>ELEC. Fear possesses me, lest any one being in the palace, on account
  of this murderous deed, should contrive evils on evils.</p>

  <p>SEMICHOR. Go, let us hasten, I indeed will guard this path, that tends
  toward where the sun flings his first rays.</p>

  <p>SEMICHOR. And I indeed this, which leads toward the west.</p>

  <p>ELEC. Now turn the glances of your eyes around in every position, now
  here, now there, then take some other view.</p>

  <p>CHOR. We are, as thou commandest.</p>

  <p>ELEC. Now roll your eyelids over your pupils, glance them every way
  through your ringlets.</p>

  <p>SEMICHOR. Is this any one here appearing in the path?&mdash;Who is
  this rustic that is standing about thy palace?</p>

  <p>ELEC. We are undone then, my friends; he will immediately show to the
  enemy the lurking beasts of prey armed with their swords.</p>

  <p>SEMICHOR. Be not afraid, the path is clear, which thou thinkest
  not.</p>

  <p>ELEC. But what?&mdash;does all with you remain secure? Give me some
  good report, whether the space before the hall be empty?</p>

  <p>SEMICHOR. All here at least is well, but look to thy province, for no
  one of the Danaids is approaching toward us.</p>

  <p>SEMICHOR. Thy report agrees with mine, for neither is there a
  disturbance here.</p>

  <p>ELEC. Come now,&mdash;I will listen at the door: why do ye delay, ye
  that are within, to sacrifice the victim, now that ye are in
  quiet?&mdash;They hear not: Alas me! wretched in misery! Are the swords
  then struck dumb at her beauty? Perhaps some Argive in arms rushing in
  with the foot of succor will approach the palace.&mdash;Now watch more
  carefully; it is no contest that admits delay; but turn <i>your eyes</i>
  some this way, and some that.</p>

  <p>CHOR. I turn each different way, looking about on all sides.</p>

  <p>HELEN. (<i>within</i>) Oh! Pelasgian Argos! I am miserably slain!</p>

  <p>ELEC. Heard ye? The men are employing their head in the
  murder.&mdash;It is the shriek of Helen, as I may conjecture.</p>

  <p>SEMICHOR. O eternal might of Jove, come to assist my friends in every
  way.</p>

  <p>HEL. Menelaus, I die! But thou art at hand, and dost not help me!</p>

  <p>ELEC. Kill, strike, slay, plunging with your hands the two
  double-edged swords into the deserter of her father, the deserter of her
  husband, who destroyed numbers of the Grecians perishing by the spear at
  the river, whence tears fell into conjunction with tears, fell on account
  of the iron weapons around the whirlpools of Scamander.</p>

  <p>CHOR. Be still, be still: I heard the sound of some one coming along
  the path around the palace.</p>

  <p>ELEC. O most dear women, in the midst of the slaughter behold Hermione
  is present; let us cease from our clamor, for she comes about to fall
  into the meshes of our toils. A goodly prey will she be, if she be taken.
  Again to your stations with a calm countenance, and with a color that
  shall not give evidence of what has been done. I too will preserve a
  pensive cast of countenance, as though perfectly unacquainted with what
  has happened.</p>

<p class="center">HERMIONE, ELECTRA, CHORUS.</p>

  <p>ELEC. O virgin, art thou come from crowning Clytæmnestra's tomb, and
  pouring libations to her manes?</p>

  <p>HERM. I am come, having obtained her good services; but some terror
  has come upon me, on account of the noise in the palace, which I hear
  being a far distance off the house.</p>

  <p>ELEC. But why? There have happened to us things worthy of groans.</p>

  <p>HERM. Speak good words; but what news dost thou tell me?</p>

  <p>ELEC. It has been decreed by this land, that Orestes and I die.</p>

  <p>HERM. No, I hope not so; you, who are my relations.</p>

  <p>ELEC. It is fixed; but we stand under the yoke of necessity.</p>

  <p>HERM. Was the noise then in the house on this account?</p>

  out&mdash;</p>

  <p>HERM. Who? for I know no more, except thou tellest me.</p>

  <p>ELEC. The wretched Orestes, that he may not die, and in behalf of
  me.</p>

  <p>HERM. For a just reason then the house lamented.</p>

  and join in supplication with thy friends, falling down before thy
  mother, the supremely blest, that Menelaus will not see us perish. But, O
  thou, that receivedst thy education at the hands of my mother, pity us,
  and alleviate our sufferings. Come hither to the trial; but I will lead
  the way, for thou alone hast the ends of our preservation.</p>

  far as lies in me.</p>

  preserve us, not thyself.</p>

  <p>ELEC. Hold her, hold her; and pointing a sword to her neck be silent,
  that Menelaus may know, that having found men, not Phrygian cowards, he
  has treated them in a manner he should treat cowards. What ho! what ho!
  my friends, make a noise, a noise, and shout before the palace, that the
  murder that is perpetrated spread not a dread alarm among the Argives, so
  that they run to assist to the king's palace, before I plainly see the
  slaughtered Helen lying weltering in her blood within the house, or else
  we hear the report from some of her attendants. For part of the havoc I
  know, and part not accurately.</p>

  filled the whole of Greece with tears on account of the ruthless,

  battle, skilled in war, cruel as the dragon. May he perish for his deep
  concealed design, the worker of evil! But they having advanced within her
  chamber, whom the archer Paris had as his wife, their eyes bathed with
  tears, they sat down in humble mien, one on each side of her, on the
  right and on the left, armed with swords. And around her knees did they
  both fling their suppliant hands, around the knees of Helen did they
  fling them. But the Phrygian attendants sprung up, and fled in amazement:
  and one called out to another in terror, <i>See</i>, lest there be
  treachery. To some indeed there appeared no danger; but to others the
  dragon stained with his mother's blood appeared bent to infold in his
  closest toils the daughter of Tyndarus.</p>

  <p>CHOR. But where wert thou then, or hadst thou long before fled through
  fear?</p>

  <p>PHRY. After the Phrygian fashion I chanced with the close circle of
  feathers to be fanning the gale, <i>that sported</i> in the ringlets of
  Helen, before her cheek, after the barbaric fashion. But she was winding
  with her fingers the flax round the distaff, but what she had spun she
  let fall on the ground, desirous of making from the Phrygian spoils a
  robe of purple as an ornament for the tomb, a gift to Clytæmnestra. But
  Orestes entreated the Spartan girl; "O daughter of Jove, here, place thy
  footstep on the ground, rising from thy seat, come to the place of our
  ancestor Pelops, the ancient altar, that thou mayest hear my words." And
  he leads her, but she followed, not dreaming of what was about to happen.
  But his accomplice, the wicked Phocian, attended to other points. "Will
  ye not depart from out of the way, but are the Phrygians always vile?"
  and he bolted us out scattered in different parts of the house, some in
  the stables of the horses, and some in the outhouses, and some here and
  there, dispersing them some one way, some another, afar from their
  mistress.</p>

  <p>CHOR. What calamity took place after this?</p>

  <p>PHRY. O powerful, powerful Idean mother, alas! alas! the murderous
  sufferings, and the lawless evils, which I saw, I saw in the royal
  palace! From beneath their purple robes concealed having their drawn
  swords in their hands, they turned each his eye on either side, lest any
  one might chance to be present. But like mountain boars standing over
  against the lady, they say, "Thou shalt die, thou shalt die! thy vile
  husband kills thee, having given up the offspring of his brother to die
  at Argos." But she shrieked out, Ah me! ah me! and throwing her white arm
  on her breast inflicted on her head miserable blows, and, her feet turned
  to flight, she stepped, she stepped with her golden sandals; but Orestes
  thrusting his fingers into her hair, outstripping her flight,<a
  name="Orest_41"></a><a href="#OrestN_41"><sup>[41]</sup></a> bending back
  her neck over his left shoulder, was about to plunge the black sword into
  her throat.</p>

  <p>CHOR. Where then were the Phrygians, who dwell under the same roof, to
  assist her?</p>

  <p>PHRY. With a clamor having burst by means of bars the doors and cells
  where we were waiting, we run to her assistance, each to different parts
  of the house, one bringing stones, another spears, another having a
  long-handled sword in his hand. But Pylades came against us, impetuous,
  like as the Phrygian Hector or Ajax in his triple-crested helmet, whom I
  saw, I saw at the gates of Priam: but we clashed together the points of
  our swords: then indeed, then did the Phrygians give clear proof how
  inferior we were in the force of Mars to the spear of Greece. One indeed
  turning away, a fugitive, but another wounded, and another deprecating
  the death that threatened him: but under favor of the darkness we fled:
  and the corses fell, but some staggered, and some lay prostrate. But the
  wretched Hermione came to the house at the time when her murdered mother
  fell to the ground, that unhappy woman that gave her birth. And running
  upon her as Bacchanals without their thyrsus, as a heifer in the
  mountains they bore her away in their hands, and again eagerly rushed
  upon the daughter of Jove to slay her. But she vanished altogether from
  the chamber through the palace. O Jupiter and O earth, and light, and
  darkness! or by her enchantments, or by the art of magic, or by the
  stealth of the Gods. But of what followed I know no farther, for I sped
  in stealth my foot from the palace. But Menelaus having endured many,
  many severe toils, has received back from Troy the violated rites of
  Helen to no purpose.</p>

  <p>CHOR. And see something strange succeeds to these strange things, for
  I see Orestes with his sword drawn walking before the palace with
  agitated step,</p>

<p class="center">ORESTES, PHRYGIAN, CHORUS.</p>

  <p>ORES. Where is he that fled from my sword out of the palace?</p>

  <p>PHRY. I supplicate thee, O king, falling prostrate before thee after
  the barbaric fashion.</p>

  <p>ORES. The case before us is not in Ilium, but the Argive land.</p>

  <p>PHRY. In every region to live is sweeter than to die, in the opinion
  of the wise.</p>

  <p>ORES. Didst thou not raise a cry for Menelaus to come with succor?</p>

  <p>PHRY. I indeed am present on purpose to assist thee; for thou art the
  more worthy.</p>

  <p>ORES. Perished then the daughter of Tyndarus justly?</p>

  <p>PHRY. Most justly, even had she three lives for vengeance.</p>

  <p>ORES. With thy tongue dost thou flatter, not having these sentiments
  within?</p>

  <p>PHRY. For ought she not? She who utterly destroyed Greece as well as
  the Phrygians themselves?</p>

  <p>ORES. Swear, I will kill thee else, that thou art not speaking to
  curry favor with me.</p>

  <p>PHRY. By my life have I sworn, which I should wish to hold a sacred
  oath.</p>

  <p>ORES. Was the steel thus dreadful to all the Phrygians at Troy
  also?</p>

  <p>PHRY. Remove thy sword, for being so near me it gleams horrid
  slaughter.</p>

  <p>ORES. Art thou afraid, lest thou shouldest become a rock, as though
  looking on the Gorgon?</p>

  <p>PHRY. Lest I should become a corse, but I know not of the Gorgon's
  head.</p>

  <p>ORES. Slave as thou art, dost thou fear death, which will rid thee
  from thy woes?</p>

  <p>PHRY. Every one, although a man be a slave, rejoices to behold the
  light.</p>

  <p>ORES. Thou sayest well; thy understanding; saves thee, but go into the
  house.</p>

  <p>PHRY. Thou wilt not kill me then?</p>

  <p>ORES. Thou art pardoned.</p>

  <p>PHRY. This is good word thou hast spoken.</p>

  <p>ORES. Yet we may change our measures.</p>

  <p>PHRY. But this thou sayest not well.</p>

  <p>ORES. Thou art a fool, if thou thinkest I could endure to defile me by
  smiting thy neck, for neither art thou a woman, nor oughtest thou to be
  ranked among men. But that thou mightest not raise a clamor came I forth
  out of the house: for Argos, when it has heard a noise, is soon roused,
  but we have no dread in meeting Menelaus, as far as swords go; but let
  him come exulting with his golden ringlets flowing over his shoulders,
  for if he collects the Argives, and brings them against the palace
  seeking revenge for the death of Helen, and is not willing to let me be
  in safety, and my sister, and Pylades my accomplice in this affair, he
  shall see two corses, both the virgin and his wife.</p>

<p class="center">CHORUS.</p>

  <p>Alas! alas! O fate, the house of the Atridæ again falls into another,
  another fearful struggle.</p>

  <p>SEMICHOR. What shall we do? shall we carry these tidings to the city,
  or shall we keep in silence?</p>

  <p>SEMICHOR. This is the safer plan, my friends.</p>

  <p>SEMICHOR. Behold before the house, behold this smoke leaping aloft in
  the air portends <i>something</i>.</p>

  <p>SEMICHOR. They are lighting the torches, as about to burn down the
  mansion of Tantalus, nor do they forbear from murder.</p>

  <p>CHOR. The God rules the events that happen to mortals, whichsoever way
  he wills. But some vast power by the instigation of the Furies has
  struck, has struck these palaces to the shedding of blood on account of
  the fall of Myrtilus from the chariot.</p>

  <p>But lo! I see Menelaus also here approaching the house with a quick
  step, having by some means or other perceived the calamity which now is
  present. Will ye not anticipate him by closing the gates with bolts, O ye
  children of Atreus, who are in the palace? A man in prosperity is a
  terrible thing to those in adversity, as now them art in misery,
  Orestes.</p>

<p class="center">MENELAUS <i>below</i>, ORESTES, PYLADES, ELECTRA, HERMIONE
<i>above</i>, CHORUS.</p>

  <p>MEN. I am present, having heard the horrid and atrocious deeds of the
  two lions, for I call them not men. For I have now heard of my wife, that
  she died not, but vanished away, this that I heard was empty report,
  which one deceived by fright related; but these are the artifices of the
  matricide, and much derision. Open some one the door, my attendants I
  command to burst open these gates here, that my child at least we may
  deliver from the hand of these blood-polluted men, and may receive my
  unhappy, my miserable lady, with whom those murderers of my wife must die
  by my hand.</p>

  <p>ORES. What ho there! Touch not these gates with thine hands: to
  Menelaus I speak, that thou towerest in thy boldness, or with this
  pinnacle will I crush thy head, having rent down the ancient battlement,
  the labor of the builders. But the gates are made fast with bolts, which
  will hinder thee from thy purpose of bringing aid, so that thou canst not
  pass within the palace.</p>

  <p>MEN. Ha! what is this? I see the blaze of torches, and these stationed
  on the battlements, on the height of the palace, and the sword placed
  over the neck of my daughter to guard her.</p>

  <p>ORES. Whether is it thy will to question, or to hear me?</p>

  <p>MEN. I wish neither, but it is necessary, as it seems, to hear
  thee.</p>

  <p>ORES. I am about to slay thy daughter if thou wish to know.</p>

  <p>MEN. Having slain Helen, dost thou perpetrate murder on murder?</p>

  <p>ORES. For would I had gained my purpose not being deluded, as I was,
  by the Gods.</p>

  <p>MEN. Thou hast slain her, and deniest it, and speakest these things to
  insult me.</p>

  <p>ORES. It is a denial that gives me pain, for would that&mdash;</p>

  <p>MEN. Thou had done what deed? for thou callest forth alarm.</p>

  <p>ORES. I had hurled to hell the fury of Greece.</p>

  <p>MEN. Give back the body of my wife, that I may bury her in a tomb.</p>

  <p>ORES. Ask her of the Gods; but I will slay thy daughter.</p>

  <p>MEN. The matricide contrives murder on murder.</p>

  <p>ORES. The avenger of his father, whom thou gavest up to die.</p>

  <p>MEN. Was not the blood of thy mother formerly shed sufficient for
  thee?</p>

  <p>ORES. I should not be weary of slaying wicked women, were I to slay
  them forever.</p>

  <p>MEN. Art thou also, Pylades, a partaker in this murder?</p>

  <p>ORES. By his silence he assents, but if I speak, it will be
  sufficient.</p>

  <p>MEN. But not with impunity, unless indeed thou fliest on wings.</p>

  <p>ORES. We will not fly, but will set fire to the palace?</p>

  <p>MEN. What! wilt thou destroy thy father's mansion?</p>

  <p>ORES. Yes, that thou mayest not possess it, will I, having stabbed
  this virgin here over the flames.</p>

  <p>MEN. Slay her; since having slain thou shalt at least give me
  satisfaction for these deeds.</p>

  <p>ORES. It shall be so then.</p>

  <p>MEN. Alas! on no account do this!</p>

  <p>ORES. Be silent then; but bear to suffer evil justly.</p>

  <p>MEN. What! is it just for thee to live?</p>

  <p>ORES. Yes, and to rule over the land.</p>

  <p>MEN. What land!</p>

  <p>ORES. Here, in Pelasgian Argos.</p>

  <p>MEN. Well wouldst thou touch the sacred lavers!</p>

  <p>ORES. And pray why not?</p>

  <p>MEN. And wouldst slaughter the victim before the battle!</p>

  <p>ORES. And thou wouldst most righteously.</p>

  <p>MEN. Yes, for I am pure as to my hands.</p>

  <p>ORES. But not thy heart.</p>

  <p>MEN. Who would speak to thee?</p>

  <p>ORES. Whoever loves his father.</p>

  <p>MEN. And whoever reveres his mother.</p>

  <p>ORES. &mdash;Is happy.</p>

  <p>MEN. Not thou at least.</p>

  <p>ORES. For wicked women please me not.</p>

  <p>MEN. Take away the sword from my daughter.</p>

  <p>ORES. Thou art false in thy expectations.</p>

  <p>MEN. But wilt thou kill my daughter?</p>

  <p>ORES. Thou art no longer false.</p>

  <p>MEN. Alas me! what shall I do?</p>

  <p>ORES. Go to the Argives, and persuade them.</p>

  <p>MEN. With what persuasion?</p>

  <p>ORES. Beseech the city that we may not die.<a name="Orest_41a"></a><a
  href="#OrestN_41a"><sup>[41a]</sup></a></p>

  <p>MEN. Otherwise ye will slay my daughter?</p>

  <p>ORES. The thing is so.</p>

  <p>MEN. O wretched Helen!&mdash;</p>

  <p>ORES. And am I not wretched?</p>

  <p>MEN. I brought thee hither from the Trojans to be a victim.</p>

  <p>ORES. For would this were so!</p>

  <p>MEN. Having endured ten thousand toils.</p>

  <p>ORES. Except on my account.</p>

  <p>MEN. I have met with dreadful treatment.</p>

  <p>ORES. For then, <i>when thou oughtest</i>, thou wert of no
  assistance.</p>

  <p>MEN. Thou hast me.</p>

  <p>ORES. Thou at least hast caught thyself. But, ho there! set fire to
  the palace, Electra, from beneath: and thou, Pylades, the most true of my
  friends, light up these battlements of the walls.</p>

  <p>MEN. O land of the Danai, and inhabitants of warlike Argos, will ye
  not, ho there! come in arms to my succor? For this man here, having
  perpetrated the shocking murder of his mother, brings destruction on your
  whole city, that he may live.</p>

<p class="center">APOLLO.</p>

  <p>Menelaus, cease from thy irritated state of mind; I Ph&#339;bus the
  son of Latona, in thy presence, am addressing thee. Thou too, Orestes,
  who standest over that damsel with thy sword drawn, that thou mayest know
  what commands I bring with me. Helen indeed, whom thou minded to destroy,
  working Menelaus to anger, didst fail of thy purpose, she is here, whom
  ye see wrapt in the bosom of the sky, preserved, and not slain by thy
  hands. Her I preserved, and snatched from thy sword, commanded by my
  father Jove. For being the daughter of Jove, it is right that she should
  live immortal. And she shall have her seat by Castor and Pollux in the
  bosom of the sky, the guardian of mariners. But take to thyself another
  bride, and lead her home, since for the beauty of this woman the Gods
  brought together the Greeks and Trojans, and caused deaths, that they
  might draw from off the earth the pride of mortals, who had become an
  infinite multitude. Thus is it with regard to Helen; but thee, on the
  other hand, Orestes, it behooveth, having passed beyond the boundaries of
  this land, to inhabit the Parrhasian plain during the revolution of a
  year, and it shall be called by a name after thy flight, so that the
  Azanes and Arcadians shall call it Oresteum: and thence having departed
  to the city of the Athenians, undergo the charge of shedding thy mother's
  blood laid by the three Furies. But the Gods the arbiters of the cause
  shall pass on thee most sacredly their decree on the hill of Mars, in
  which it behooveth thee to be victorious. But Hermione, to whose neck
  thou art holding the sword, it is destined for thee, Orestes, to wed, but
  Neoptolemus, who thinks to marry her, shall never marry her. For it is
  fated to him to die by the Delphic sword, as he is demanding of me
  satisfaction for his father Achilles. But to Pylades give thy sister's
  hand, as thou didst formerly agree, but a happy life now coming on awaits
  him. But, O Menelaus, suffer Orestes to reign over Argos. But depart and
  rule over the Spartan land, having it as thy wife's dowry, who exposing
  thee to numberless evils always was bringing thee to this. But what
  regards the city I will make all right for him, I, who compelled him to
  slay his mother.</p>

  <p>ORES. O Loxian prophet, thou wert not then a false prophet in thine
  oracles, but a true one. And yet a fear comes upon me, that having heard
  one of the Furies, I might think that I have been hearing thy voice. But
  it is well fulfilled, and I will obey thy words. Behold I let go Hermione
  from slaughter, and approve her alliance, whenever her father shall give
  her.</p>

  <p>MEN. O Helen, daughter of Jove, hail! but I bless thee inhabiting the
  happy mansions of the Gods. But to thee, Orestes, do I betroth my
  daughter at Ph&#339;bus's commands, but illustrious thyself marrying from
  an illustrious family, be happy, both thou and I who give her.</p>

  <p>APOL. Now depart each of you whither we have appointed, and dissolve
  your quarrels.</p>

  <p>MEN. It is our duty to obey.</p>

  <p>ORES. I too entertain the same sentiments, and I receive with
  friendship thee in thy sufferings, O Menelaus, and thy oracles, O
  Apollo.</p>

  <p>APOL. Go now, each his own way, honoring the most excellent goddess
  Peace; but I will convey Helen to the mansions of Jove, passing through
  the pole of the shining stars, where sitting by Juno, and Hercules's
  Hebe, a goddess, she shall ever be honored by mortals with libations, in
  conjunction with the Tyndaridæ, the sons of Jove, presiding over the sea
  to the benefit of mariners.</p>

  <p>CHOR. O greatly glorious Victory, mayest thou uphold my life, and
  cease not from crowning me!</p>

  that whichever should discover the first prodigy should have possession
  of the throne. There appeared in Atreus's flock a golden lamb, which,
  however, Ærope his wife secretly had conveyed to Thyestes to show before
  the judges. Atreus afterward invited Thyestes to a feast, and served up

<h3>THE ARGUMENT.</h3>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Eteocles having gotten possession of the throne of Thebes, deprived
  his brother Polynices of his share; but he having come as an exile to
  Argos, married the daughter of the king Adrastus; but ambitious of
  returning to his country, and having persuaded his father-in-law, he
  assembled a great army for Thebes against his brother. His mother Jocasta
  made him come into the city, under sanction of a truce, and first confer
  with his brother respecting the empire. But Eteocles being violent and
  fierce from having possessed the empire, Jocasta could not reconcile her
  children.&mdash;Polynices, prepared as against an enemy, rushed out of
  the city. Now Tiresias prophesied that victory should be on the side of
  the Thebans, if Men&#339;ceus the son of Creon would give himself up to
  be sacrificed to Mars. Creon refused to give his son to the city, but the
  youth was willing, and, his father pointing out to him the means of
  flight and giving him money, he put himself to death.&mdash;The Thebans
  slew the leaders of the Argives. Eteocles and Polynices in a single
  combat slew each other, and their mother having found the corses of her
  sons laid violent hands on herself; and Creon her brother received the
  kingdom. The Argives defeated in battle retired. But Creon, being morose,
  would not give up those of the enemy who had fallen at Thebes, for
  sepulture, and exposed the body of Polynices without burial, and banished
  &#338;dipus from his country; in the one instance disregarding the laws
  of humanity, in the other giving way to passion, nor feeling pity for him
  after his calamity.</p>

  name="Phoen_1"></a><a href="#PhoenN_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> of heaven, and
  art mounted on thy golden-joined seats, thou sun, whirling thy flame
  with<a name="Phoen_2"></a><a href="#PhoenN_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> thy
  swift steeds, how inauspicious didst thou dart thy ray on that day when
  Cadmus came to this land having left the sea-washed coast of
  Ph&#339;nicia; who in former time having married Harmonia, daughter of
  Venus, begat Polydorus; from him they say sprung Labdacus, and from him
  Laius. But I am<a name="Phoen_3"></a><a
  href="#PhoenN_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> the daughter of Men&#339;ceus, and
  Creon my brother was born of the same mother; me they call Jocasta (for
  this name<a name="Phoen_4"></a><a href="#PhoenN_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> my
  father gave me), and Laius takes me for his wife; but after that he was
  childless, for a long time sharing my bed in the palace, he went and
  inquired of Apollo, and at the same time demands the mutual offspring of
  male children in his family; but the God said, "O king of Thebes renowned
  for its chariots, sow not for such a harvest of children against the will
  of the Gods, for if thou shalt beget a son, he that is born shall slay
  thee, and the whole of thy house shall wade through blood." But having
  yielded to pleasure, and having fallen into inebriety, he begot to us a
  son, and having begot him, feeling conscious of his error and the command
  of the God, gives the babe to some herdsmen to expose at the meads of
  Juno and the rock of Cithæron, having bored sharp-pointed iron through
  the middle of his ankles, from which circumstance Greece gave him the
  name of &#338;dipus. But him the grooms who attend the steeds of Polybus
  find and carry home, and placed him in the arms of their mistress. But
  she rested beneath her bosom him that gave me a mother's pangs, and
  persuades her husband that she had brought forth. But now my son showing
  signs of manhood in his darkening cheek, either having suspected it by
  instinct, or having learned it from some one, went to the temple of
  Apollo, desirous of discovering his parents; at the same time went Laius
  my husband, seeking to gain intelligence of his son who had been exposed,
  if he were no longer living; and both met at the same point of the road
  at Phocis where it divides itself; and the charioteer of Laius commands
  him, "Stranger, withdraw out of the way of princes;" but he moved slowly,
  in silence, with haughty spirit; but the steeds with their hoof dyed with
  blood the tendons of his feet. At this (but why need I relate each horrid
  circumstance besides the deed itself?) the son kills his father, and
  having taken the chariot, sends it as a present to his foster-father
  Polybus. Now at this time the sphinx preyed vulture-like<a
  name="Phoen_5"></a><a href="#PhoenN_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> upon the city
  with rapacity, my husband now no more, Creon my brother proclaims that he
  will give my bed as a reward to him who would solve the enigma of the
  crafty virgin. But by some chance or other &#338;dipus my son happens to
  discover the riddle of the sphinx, [and he receives as a prize the
  sceptre of this land,]<a name="Phoen_5a"></a><a
  href="#PhoenN_5a"><sup>[5a]</sup></a> and marries me, his mother,
  wretched he not knowing it, nor knew his mother that she was lying down
  with her son. And I bear children to my child, two sons, Eteocles and the
  illustrious Polynices, and two daughters, one her father named Ismene,
  the elder I called Antigone. But &#338;dipus, after having gone through
  all sufferings, having discovered in my bed the marriage with his mother,
  he perpetrated a deed of horror on his own eyes, having drenched in blood
  their pupils with his golden buckles. But after that the cheek of my
  children grows dark with manly down, they hid their father confined with
  bolts that his sad fortune might be forgotten, which indeed required the
  greatest policy. He is still living in the palace, but sick in mind
  through his misfortunes he imprecates the most unhallowed curses on his
  children, that they may share this house with the sharpened sword. But
  these two, dreading lest the Gods should bring to completion these
  curses,<a name="Phoen_6"></a><a href="#PhoenN_6"><sup>[6]</sup></a>
  should they dwell together, in friendly compact determined that Polynices
  the younger son should first go a willing exile from this land, but that
  Eteocles remaining here should hold the sceptre for a year, changing in
  his turn; but after that he sat on the throne of power, he moves not from
  his seat, but drives Polynices an exile from this land. But he having
  fled to Argos, and having contracted an alliance with Adrastus, assembles
  together and leads a vast army of Argives; and having marched to these
  very walls with seven gates he demands his father's sceptre and his share
  of the land. But I to quell this strife persuaded my son to come to his
  brother, confiding in a truce before he grasped the spear. And the
  messenger who was sent declares that he will come. But, O thou that
  inhabitest the shining clouds of heaven, Jove, preserve us, give
  reconciliation to my children; it becomes thee, if thou art wise, not to
  suffer the same man always to be unfortunate.</p>

<p class="center">TUTOR, ANTIGONE.</p>

  <p>TUT. O thou fair bud in thy father's house, Antigone, since thy mother
  has permitted thee to leave the virgin's apartments for the extreme
  chamber<a name="Phoen_7"></a><a href="#PhoenN_7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> of
  the mansion, in order to view the Argive army in compliance with thy
  entreaties, yet stay, until I shall first investigate the path, lest any
  citizen should appear in the pass, and to me taunts should come as a
  slave, and to thee as a princess: and I who well know each circumstance
  will tell you all that I saw or heard from the Argives, when I went
  bearing the offer of a truce to thy brother, from this place thither, and
  again to this place from him. But no citizen approaches this house; come,
  ascend with thy steps these ancient stairs of cedar, and survey the
  plains, and by the streams of Ismenus and Dirce's fount how great is the
  host of the enemy.</p>

  <p>ANT. Stretch forth now, stretch forth thine aged hand from the stairs
  to my youth, raising up the steps of my feet.</p>

  <p>TUT. Behold, join thy hand, virgin, thou hast come in lucky hour, for
  the Pelasgian host is now in motion, and they are separating the bands
  from one another.</p>

  <p>ANT. O awful daughter of Latona, Hecate, the field all brass<a
  name="Phoen_8"></a><a href="#PhoenN_8"><sup>[8]</sup></a> gleaming like
  lightning.</p>

  <p>TUT. For Polynices hath not come tamely to this land, raging with host
  of horsemen, and ten thousand shields.</p>

  <p>ANT. Are the gates fastened with bars, and is the brazen bolt fitted
  to the stone-work of Amphion's wall?</p>

  <p>TUT. Take courage; as to the interior the city is safe, But view the
  first chief, if thou desirest to know.</p>

  <p>ANT. Who is he with the white-plumed helmet, who commands in the van
  of the army, moving lightly round on his arm his brazen shield?</p>

  <p>TUT. He is a leader, lady.</p>

  <p>ANT. Who is he? From whom sprung? Speak, aged man, what is he called
  by name?</p>

  <p>TUT. He indeed is called by birth a Mycenæan, and he dwells at the
  streams of Lerna,<a name="Phoen_9"></a><a
  href="#PhoenN_9"><sup>[9]</sup></a> the king Hippomedon.</p>

  <p>ANT. Ah! how haughty, how terrible to behold! like to an earth-born
  giant, starlike in countenance amidst his painted devices,<a
  name="Phoen_10"></a><a href="#PhoenN_10"><sup>[10]</sup></a> he
  corresponds not with the race of mortals.</p>

  <p>TUT. Dost thou not see him now passing the stream of Dirce, a
  general?</p>

  <p>ANT. Here is another, another fashion of arms. But who is he?</p>

  <p>TUT. He is the son of &#338;neus, Tydeus, and bears on his breast the
  Ætolian Mars.</p>

  <p>ANT. Is this the prince, O aged man, who is husband to the sister of
  my brother's wife?<a name="Phoen_11"></a><a
  href="#PhoenN_11"><sup>[11]</sup></a> In his arms how different of color,
  of barbaric mixture!</p>

  <p>TUT. For all the Ætolians, my child, bear the target, and hurl with
  the lance, most certain in their aim.</p>

  <p>ANT. But how, O aged man, dost thou know these things so
  perfectly?</p>

  <p>TUT. Having seen the devices of the shields, then I remarked them,
  when I went to bear the offer of a truce to thy brother, beholding which,
  I recognize the warriors.</p>

  <p>ANT. But who is this, who is passing round the tomb of Zethus, with
  clustering locks, in his eyes a Gorgon to behold, in appearance a
  youth?</p>

  <p>TUT. A general he is. [See Note <a name="Phoen_A"></a><a
  href="#PhoenN_A">[A]</a>.]</p>

  <p>ANT. How a crowd in complete armor attends him behind!<a
  name="Phoen_12"></a><a href="#PhoenN_12"><sup>[12]</sup></a></p>

  <p>TUT. This is Parthenopæus, son of Atalanta.</p>

  <p>ANT. But, may Diana who rushes over the mountains with his mother
  destroy him, having subdued him with her arrows, who has come against my
  city to destroy it.</p>

  <p>TUT. May it be so, my child, nevertheless they are come with justice
  to this land; wherefore also I fear lest the Gods should judge
  rightly.</p>

  <p>ANT. Where, but where is he who was born of one mother with me in hard
  fate, O dearest old man; tell me, where is Polynices?</p>

  <p>TUT. He is standing near the tomb of the seven virgin daughters of
  Niobe, close by Adrastus. Seest thou him?</p>

  <p>ANT. I see indeed, but not distinctly; but somehow I see the
  resemblance of his form, and his shape shadowed out. Would that with my
  feet I could perform the journey of the winged cloud through the air to
  my brother, then would I fling my arms round his dearest neck, after so
  long a time a wretched exile. How splendid is he, O old man, in his
  golden armor, glittering like the morning rays of the sun.</p>

  <p>TUT. He will come to this house confiding in the truce, so as to fill
  thee with joy.</p>

  <p>ANT. But who, O aged man, is this, who guides his milk-white steeds
  seated in his chariot?</p>

  <p>TUT. The prophet Amphiaraus this, O my mistress, and with him the
  victims, the libations of the earth delighting in blood.</p>

  <p>AST. O thou daughter of the brightly girded sun, thou moon,
  golden-circled light, applying what quiet and temperate blows to his
  steeds does he direct his chariot! But where is he who utters such
  dreadful insults against this city, Capaneus?</p>

  <p>TUT. He is scanning the approach to the towers, measuring the walls
  both from their foundation to the top.</p>

  <p>ANT. O vengeance, and ye loud-roaring thunders of Jove, and thou
  blasting fire of the lightning, do thou quell this more-than-mortal
  arrogance. This is he who will with his spear give to Mycenæ, and to the
  streams of Lernæan Triæna,<a name="Phoen_13"></a><a
  href="#PhoenN_13"><sup>[13]</sup></a> and to the Amymonian<a
  name="Phoen_14"></a><a href="#PhoenN_14"><sup>[14]</sup></a> waters of
  Neptune, the Theban women, having invested them with slavery. Sever, O
  awful Goddess, never, O daughter of Jove, with golden clusters of
  ringlets, Diana, may I endure servitude.</p>

  <p>TUT. My child, enter the palace, and at home remain in thy virgin
  chambers, since thou hast arrived at the indulgement of thy desire, as to
  what you were anxious to behold. For, since confusion has entered the
  city, a crowd of women is advancing to the royal palace. The race of
  women is prone to complaint, and if they find but small occasion for
  words, they add more, and it is a sort of pleasure to women, to speak
  nothing well-advised one of another.<a name="Phoen_15"></a><a
  href="#PhoenN_15"><sup>[15]</sup></a></p>

<p class="center">CHORUS.</p>

  <p>I have come, having left the Tyrian wave, the first-fruits of Loxias,
  from the sea-washed Ph&#339;nicia, a slave for the shrine of Apollo, that
  I might dwell under the snowy brows of Parnassus, having sped my way over
  the Ionian flood by the oar, the west wind with its blasts riding over
  the barren plains of waters<a name="Phoen_16"></a><a
  href="#PhoenN_16"><sup>[16]</sup></a> which flow round Sicily, the
  sweetest murmur in the heavens. Chosen out from my city the fairest
  present to Apollo, I came to the land of the Cadmeans, the illustrious
  descendants of Agenor, sent hither to these kindred towers of Laius. And
  I am made the slave of Apollo in like manner with the golden-framed
  images. Moreover the water of Castalia awaits me, to lave the virgin
  pride of my tresses, in the ministry of Apollo. O blazing rock, the flame
  of fire that seems<a name="Phoen_17"></a><a
  href="#PhoenN_17"><sup>[17]</sup></a> double above the Dionysian heights
  of Bacchus, and thou vine, who distillest the daily nectar, producing the
  fruitful cluster from the tender shoot; and ye divine caves of the
  dragon,<a name="Phoen_18"></a><a href="#PhoenN_18"><sup>[18]</sup></a>
  and ye mountain watch-towers of the Gods, and thou hallowed snowy
  mountain, would that I were the chorus of the immortal God free from
  alarms encompassing thee around, by the caves of Apollo in the centre of
  the earth, having left Dirce. But now impetuous Mars having advanced
  before the walls lights up against this city, which may the Gods avert,
  hostile war; for common are the misfortunes of friends, and common is it,
  if this land defended by its seven turrets should suffer any calamity, to
  the Ph&#339;nician country, alas! alas! common is the affinity,<a
  name="Phoen_19"></a><a href="#PhoenN_19"><sup>[19]</sup></a> common are
  the descendants of Io bearing horns; of which woes I have a share. But a
  thick cloud of shields glares around the city, the likeness of gory
  battle, bearing which destruction from the Furies to the children of
  &#338;dipus Mars shall quickly advance. O Pelasgian Argos, I dread thy
  power, and vengeance from the Gods, for he rushes not his arms to this
  war unjustly, who seeks to recover his home.</p>

<p class="center">POLYNICES, CHORUS.</p>

  <p>POL. The bolts indeed of the gate-keepers have with ease admitted me,
  that I might come within the walls; wherefore also I fear, lest, having
  caught me within their nets, they let<a name="Phoen_19a"></a><a
  href="#PhoenN_19a"><sup>[19a]</sup></a> not my body go without bloodshed.
  On which account my eye must be turned about on every side, both that way
  and this, lest there be treachery. But armed in my hand with this sword,
  I will give myself confidence of daring. Ha! Who is this; or do we fear a
  noise? Every thing appears terrible even to the bold, when his foot shall
  pass across a hostile country. I trust however in my mother, at the same
  time I scarce trust, who persuaded me to come hither confiding in a
  truce. But protection is nigh; for the hearths of the altars are at hand,
  and houses not deserted. Come. I will let go my sword into its dark
  scabbard, and will question these who they are, that are standing at the
  palace. Ye female strangers, tell me, from what country do ye approach
  Grecian habitations?</p>

  <p>CHOR. The Ph&#339;nician is my paternal country, she that nurtured me:
  and the descendants of Agenor sent me hither from the spoils, the
  first-fruits to Apollo. And while the renowned son of &#338;dipus was
  preparing to send me to the revered shrine, and to the altars of
  Ph&#339;bus, in the mean time the Argives marched against the city. But
  do thou in turn answer me, who thou art, who hast come to this bulwark of
  the Theban land with its seven gates?</p>

  <p>POL. My father is &#338;dipus the son of Laius; Jocasta daughter of
  Men&#339;ceus brought me forth; the Theban people call me Polynices.</p>

  <p>CHOR. O thou allied to the sons of Agenor, my lords, by whom I was
  sent, I fall at thy knees in lowly posture, O king, preserving my
  country's custom. Thou hast come, thou hast come, after a length of time,
  to thy paternal land. O venerable matron, come forth quickly, open the
  doors; dost thou hear, O mother, that producedst this hero? why dost thou
  delay to leave thy lofty mansion, and to embrace thy child with thine
  arms?</p>

<p class="center">JOCASTA, POLYNICES, CHORUS.</p>

  <p>JOC. Hearing the Ph&#339;nician tongue, ye virgins, within this
  mansion, I drag my steps trembling with age. Ah! my son, after length of
  time, after numberless days, I behold thy countenance; clasp thy mother's
  bosom in thine arms, throw around her<a name="Phoen_20"></a><a
  href="#PhoenN_20"><sup>[20]</sup></a> thy kisses, and the dark ringlets
  of thy clustering hair, shading my neck. Ah! scarce possible is it that
  thou appearest in thy mother's arms so unhoped for, and so unexpected.
  How shall I address thee? how shall I perform all? how shall I, walking
  in rapture around thee on that side and this, both with my hands and
  words, reap the varied pleasure, the delight of my former joys? O my son,
  thou hast left thy father's house deserted, sent away an exile by
  wrongful treatment from thy brother. How longed for by thy friends! how
  longed for by Thebes! From which time I am both shorn of my hoary locks,
  letting them fall with tears, with wailing;<a name="Phoen_21"></a><a
  href="#PhoenN_21"><sup>[21]</sup></a> deprived, my child, of the white
  robes, I receive in exchange around me these dark and dismal weeds. But
  the old man in the palace deprived of sight, always preserving with tears
  regret for the unanimity of the brothers which is separated from the
  family, has madly rushed on self-destruction with the sword and with the
  noose above the beams of the house, bewailing the curse imprecated on his
  children; and with cries of woe he is always hidden in darkness. But
  thou, my child, I hear, art both joined in marriage, and hast the joys of
  love in a foreign family, and cherishest a foreign alliance; intolerable
  to this thy mother and to the aged Laius, the woe of a foreign marriage
  brought upon us. But neither did I light the torch of fire for you, as is
  customary in the marriage rites, as befits the happy mother; nor was
  Ismenus careful of the bridal rites in the luxury of the bath: and the
  entrance of thy bride was made in silence through the Theban city. May
  these ills perish, whether the sword, or discord, or thy father is the
  cause, or whether fate has rushed with violence upon the house of
  &#338;dipus; for the weight of these sorrows has fallen upon me.</p>

  <p>CHOR. Parturition with the attendant throes has a wonderful effect on
  women;<a name="Phoen_22"></a><a href="#PhoenN_22"><sup>[22]</sup></a> and
  somehow the whole race of women have strong affection toward their
  children.</p>

  <p>POL. My mother, determining wisely, and yet not determining wisely,
  have I come to men my foes; but it is necessary that all must be enamored
  of their country; but whoever says otherwise, pleases himself with vain
  words, but has his heart there. But so far have I come to trouble and
  terror, lest any treachery from my brother should slay me, so that having
  my hand on my sword I proceeded through the city rolling round my eye;
  but one thing is on my side, the truce and thy faith, which has brought
  me within my paternal walls: but I have come with many tears, after a
  length of time beholding the courts and the altars of the Gods, and the
  schools wherein I was brought up, and the fount of Dirce, from which
  banished by injustice, I inhabit a foreign city, having a stream of tears
  flowing through my eyes. But, for from one woe springs a second, I behold
  thee having thy head shorn of its locks, and these sable garments; alas
  me! on account of my misfortunes. How dreadful a thing, mother, is the
  enmity of relations, having means of reconciliation seldom to be brought
  about! For how fares the old man my father in the palace, vainly looking
  upon darkness; and how fare my two sisters? Are they indeed bewailing my
  wretched banishment?</p>

  <p>JOC. Some God miserably destroys the race of &#338;dipus; for thus
  began it, when I brought forth children in that unhallowed manner, and
  thy father married me in evil hour, and thou didst spring forth. But why
  relate these things? What is sent by the Gods we must bear. But how I may
  ask the questions I wish, I know not, for I fear lest I wound at all thy
  feelings; but I have a great desire.</p>

  <p>POL. But inquire freely, leave nothing out. For what you wish, my
  mother, this is dear to me.</p>

  <p>JOC. I ask thee therefore, first, for the information that I wish to
  obtain. What is the being deprived of one's country, is it a great
  ill?</p>

  <p>POL. The greatest: and greater is it in deed than in word.</p>

  <p>JOC. What is the reason of that? What is that so harsh to exiles?</p>

  <p>POL. One thing, and that the greatest, not to have the liberty of
  speaking.</p>

  <p>JOC. This that you have mentioned belongs to a slave, not to give
  utterance to what one thinks.</p>

  <p>POL. It is necessary to bear with the follies of those in power.</p>

  <p>JOC. And this is painful, to be unwise with the unwise.</p>

  <p>POL. But for interest we must bend to slavery contrary to our
  nature.</p>

  <p>JOC. But hopes support exiles, as report goes.</p>

  <p>POL. They look upon them with favorable eyes, at least, but are slow
  of foot.</p>

  <p>JOC. Hath not time shown them to be vain?</p>

  <p>POL. They have a certain sweet delight to set against misfortunes.</p>

  <p>JOC. But whence wert thou supported, before thou foundest means of
  sustenance by thy marriage?</p>

  <p>POL. At one time I had food for the day, at another I had not.</p>

  <p>JOC. And did the friends and hosts of your father not assist you?</p>

  <p>POL. Be prosperous, <i>and thou shalt have friends</i>:<a
  name="Phoen_23"></a><a href="#PhoenN_23"><sup>[23]</sup></a> but friends
  are none, should one be in adversity.</p>

  <p>JOC. Did not thy noble birth raise thee to great distinction?</p>

  <p>POL. To want is wretched; high birth fed me not.</p>

  <p>JOC. Their own country, it appears, is the dearest thing to men.</p>

  <p>POL. You can not express by words how dear it is.</p>

  <p>JOC. But how camest thou to Argos? What intention hadst thou?</p>

  <p>POL. Apollo gave a certain oracle to Adrastus.</p>

  <p>JOC. What is this thou hast mentioned? I am unable to discover.</p>

  <p>POL. To unite his daughters in marriage with a boar and lion.</p>

  <p>JOC. And what part of the name of beasts belongs to you, my son.</p>

  <p>POL. I know not. The God called me to this fortune.</p>

  <p>JOC. For the God is wise. But in what manner didst thou obtain her
  bed?</p>

  <p>POL. It was night; but I came to the portals of Adrastus.</p>

  <p>JOC. In search of a couch to rest on, as a wandering exile?</p>

  <p>POL. This was the case, and then indeed there came a second exile.</p>

  <p>JOC. Who was this? how unfortunate then was he also!</p>

  <p>POL. Tydeus, who they say sprung from &#338;neus his sire.</p>

  <p>JOC. In what then did Adrastus liken you to beasts?</p>

  <p>POL. Because we came to blows for lodging.</p>

  <p>JOC. In this the son of Talaus understood the oracle.</p>

  <p>POL. And gave in marriage to us two his two virgin daughters.</p>

  <p>JOC. Art thou fortunate then in thy marriage alliance, or
  unfortunate?</p>

  <p>POL. My marriage can not be found fault with up to this day.</p>

  <p>JOC. But how didst thou persuade an army to follow you hither?</p>

  <p>POL. Adrastus swore this oath to his two sons-in-law, that he would
  replace both in their own country, but me first. And many princes of the
  Argives and Mycenæans are at hand, rendering to me a sad, but necessary
  favor; for I am leading an army against this my own city; but I have
  called the Gods to witness how unwillingly I have raised the spear
  against my dearest parents. But the dissolution of these ills extends to
  thee, my mother, that having reconciled the friendly brothers, you may
  free from toil me and thyself, and the whole city. It is a proverb long
  ago chanted, but nevertheless I will repeat it; wealth is honored most of
  all things by men, and has the greatest influence of any thing among men.
  In pursuit of which I am come, leading hither ten thousand spears: for a
  nobly-born man in poverty is nothing.</p>

  <p>CHOR. And see Eteocles here comes to this mediation; thy business it
  is, O Jocasta, being their mother, to speak words, with which thou shalt
  reconcile thy children.</p>

<p class="center">ETEOCLES, POLYNICES, JOCASTA, CHORUS.</p>

  <p>ETEO. Mother, I am present; giving this grace to thee, I have come;
  what must I do? Let some one begin the conference. Since arranging also
  around the walls the chariots of the bands, I restrained the city, that I
  may hear from thee the common terms<a name="Phoen_24"></a><a
  href="#PhoenN_24"><sup>[24]</sup></a> of reconciliation, for which thou
  hast permitted this man to come within the walls under sanction of a
  truce, having persuaded me.</p>

  <p>JOC. Stay; precipitate haste has not justice; but slow counsels
  perform most deeds in wisdom. But repress that fierce eye and those
  blasts of rage; for thou art not looking on the Gorgon's head cut off at
  the neck, but thou art looking on thy brother who is come to thee. And do
  thou again, Polynices, turn thy face toward thy brother; for looking at
  the same point with thine eyes, thou wilt both speak better, and receive
  his words better. But I wish to give you a wise piece of advice. When a
  friend is enraged with a man his friend, having met him face to face, let
  him fix his eyes on his friend's eyes, this only ought he to consider,
  the end for which he is come, but to have no recollection of former
  grievances. Thy words then first, my son, Polynices; for thou art come
  leading an army of Argives, having suffered injustice, as thou sayest;
  and may some God be umpire and the reconciler of your strife.</p>

  <p>POL. The speech of truth is simple, and those things which are just
  need not wily interpretations; for they have energy themselves; but the
  unjust speech, unsound in itself, requires cunning preparations to gloze
  it. But I have previously considered for my father's house, and my own
  advantage and that of this man; desiring to escape the curses, which
  &#338;dipus denounced formerly against us, I myself of my own accord
  departed from this land, having given him to rule over his own country
  for the space of a year, so that I myself should have the government
  again, having received it in turn, and not having come into enmity and
  bloodshed with this man to perform some evil deed, and to suffer what is
  now taking place. But he having assented to this, and having brought the
  Gods to witness his oaths, has performed nothing of what he promised, but
  himself holds the regal power and my share of the palace. And now I am
  ready, having received my own right, to send the army away from out of
  this land, and to regulate my house, having received it in my turn, and
  to give it up again to this man for the same space of time, and neither
  to lay my country waste, nor to apply to its towers the means of ascent
  by the firmly-fixed ladders. Which, should I not meet with justice, will
  I endeavor to put in execution: and I call the Gods as witnesses of this,
  that acting in every thing with justice, I am without justice deprived of
  my country in the most unrighteous manner. These individual
  circumstances, mother, not having collected together intricacies of
  argument, have I declared, but both to the wise and to the illiterate
  just, as appears to me.</p>

  <p>CHOR. To me indeed, although we have not been brought up according to
  the Grecian land, nevertheless to me thou appearest to speak with
  judgment.</p>

  <p>ETEO. If the same thing were judged honorable alike by all, and at the
  same time wise, there would not be doubtful strife among men. But now
  nothing is similar, nothing the same among mortals, except in names; but
  the sense is not the same, for I, my mother, will speak having kept
  nothing back; I would mount to the rising of the stars, and sink beneath
  the earth, were I able to perform this, so that I might possess the
  greatest of the Goddesses, kingly power.<a name="Phoen_25"></a><a
  href="#PhoenN_25"><sup>[25]</sup></a> This prize then, my mother, I am
  not willing rather to give up to another, than to preserve for myself.
  For it implies cowardice in him, whoever having lost the greater share,
  hath received the less; but in addition to this I feel ashamed, that this
  man having come with arms, and laying the country waste, should obtain
  what he wishes; for to Thebes this would be a reproach, if through fear
  of the Mycenæan spear I should give up my sceptre for this man to hold.
  But he ought, my mother, to effect a reconciliation, not by arms: for
  speech does every thing which even the sword of the enemy could do. But
  if he is desirous of inhabiting this land in any other way, it is in his
  power; but the other point I will never give up willingly. When it is in
  my power to rule, ever to be a slave to him? Wherefore come fire, come
  sword, yoke thy steeds, fill the plains with chariots, since I will not
  give up my kingly power to this man. For if one must be unjust, it is
  most glorious to be unjust concerning empire, but in every thing else one
  should be just.</p>

  <p>CHOR. It is not right to speak well, where the deeds are not glorious;
  for this is not honorable, but galling to justice.</p>

  <p>JOC. My son, Eteocles, not every ill is added to age, but experience
  has it in its power to evince more wisdom than youth.<a
  name="Phoen_26"></a><a href="#PhoenN_26"><sup>[26]</sup></a> Why, my
  child, dost thou so desirously court ambition, the most baneful of the
  deities? do not thou; the Goddess is unjust. But she hath entered into
  many families and happy states and hath come forth again, to the
  destruction of those who have to do with her. Of whom thou art madly
  enamored. This is more noble, my son, to honor equality, which ever links
  friends with friends, and states with states, and allies with allies: for
  equality is sanctioned by law among men. But the lesser share is ever at
  enmity with the greater, and straight begins the day of hatred. For
  equality arranged also among mortals measures, and the divisions of
  weights, and defined numbers. And the dark eye of night, and the light of
  the sun, equally walk their annual round, and neither of them being
  overcome hath envy of the other. Thus the sun and the night are
  subservient to men, but wilt not thou brook having an equal share of
  government, and give his share to him? Then where is justice? Why dost
  thou honor so unboundedly that prosperous injustice, royalty, and think
  so highly of her? Is the being conspicuous honorable? At least, it is
  empty honor. Or dost thou desire to labor much, possessing much in thy
  house? but what is superfluity? It possesses but a name; since a
  sufficiency indeed to the temperate is abundance. Neither do men enjoy
  riches as their own, but having the property of the Gods do we cherish
  them. And when they list, again do they take them away. Come, if I ask
  thee, having proposed together two measures, whether it is thy wish to
  reign, or save the city? Wilt thou say, to reign? But should he conquer
  thee, and the Argive spears overcome the Cadmæanforces, thou wilt behold
  this city of the Thebans vanquished, thou wilt behold many captive
  maidens with violence ravished by men your foes. Bitter then to Thebes
  will be the power which thou seekest to hold; but yet thou art ambitious
  of it. To thee I say this: but to thee, Polynices, say I, that Adrastus
  hath conferred an unwise favor on thee; and foolishly hast thou also come
  to destroy this city. Come, if thou wilt subdue this land (may which
  never happen), by the Gods, how wilt thou erect trophies of thy spear?
  And how again wilt thou sacrifice the first-fruits, having conquered thy
  country? and how wilt thou engrave upon the spoils by the waters of
  Inachus, "Having laid Thebes in ashes, Polynices consecrated these
  shields to the Gods?" Never, my son, may it come to thee to receive such
  glory from the Greeks. But again, shouldest thou be conquered, and should
  the arms of the other prevail, how wilt thou return to Argos having left
  behind ten thousand dead? Surely some one will say, O! unfortunate
  marriage alliance! O Adrastus, who placed them on us, through the
  nuptials of one bride we are lost! Thou art hastening two ills, my son,
  to be deprived of those, and to fail in this. Give up your too great
  ardor, give it up; the follies of two when they clash together in the
  same point, are the most hateful ill.</p>

  <p>CHOR. O ye Gods, may ye be averters of these ills, and grant to the
  children of &#338;dipus some means of agreement.</p>

  <p>ETEO. My mother, this is not a contest of words, but intervening time
  is fruitlessly wasted; and thy earnestness avails nothing; for we shall
  not agree in any other way, than on the terms proposed, that I holding
  the sceptre be monarch of this land. Forbearing then tedious admonitions,
  let me have my way; and do thou begone from out these walls, or thou
  shalt die.</p>

  <p>POL. By whose hand? Who is there so invulnerable, who having pointed
  the murderous sword against me, shall not bear the same fate?</p>

  <p>ETEO. He is near, not far removed from thee: dost thou look on these
  my hands?</p>

  <p>POL. I see them. But wealth is cowardly, and feeble, loving life.</p>

  <p>ETEO. And therefore hast thou come, with such a host against one who
  is nothing in arms?</p>

  <p>POL. For a cautious general is better than one daring.</p>

  inactivity. But I call to witness the land that nurtured me, and the
  Gods, how dishonored I am driven from this land, suffering such foul
  treatment, as a slave and not born of the same father &#338;dipus. And if
  any thing befalls thee, my city, blame not me, but him; for against my
  will have I come, and against my will am I driven from this land. And
  thou, king Apollo, God of our streets, and ye shrines, farewell, and ye
  my equals, and ye altars of the Gods receiving the victims; for I know
  not if it is allowed me ever again to address you. But hope does not yet
  slumber, in which I have trusted with the favor of the Gods, that having
  slain this man, I shall be master of this Theban land.</p>

  <p>ETEO. Depart from out of the country; with truth indeed did your
  father give you the name of Polynices by some divine foreknowledge, a
  name corresponding with strife.</p>

<p class="center">CHORUS.</p>

  <p>Cadmus came from Tyre to this land, before whom the quadrupede heifer
  bent with willing fall,<a name="Phoen_28"></a><a
  href="#PhoenN_28"><sup>[28]</sup></a> showing the accomplishment of the
  oracle, where the divine word ordered him to colonize the plains of the
  Aonians productive of wheat, where indeed the fair-flowing stream of the
  water of Dirce passes over the verdant and deep-furrowed fields, where
  the *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* mother produced Bacchus, by her marriage with Jove, whom the
  wreathed ivy twining around him instantly, while yet a babe, blest and
  covered with its verdant shady branches, an event to be celebrated with
  Bacchic revel by the Theban virgins and inspired women. There was the
  bloodstained dragon of Mars, the savage guard, watching with far-rolling
  eyeballs over the flowing fountains and grassy streams; whom Cadmus,
  having come for water for purification, slew with a fragment of rock, the
  destroyer of the monster having thrown his arms with blows on his
  blood-stained head, by the counsel of the divine Pallas born without
  mother, having thrown the teeth fallen to the earth upon the
  deep-furrowed plains. Whence the earth sent forth a spectacle, an armed
  [host] above the extreme limits of the ground; but iron-hearted slaughter
  again united them with their beloved earth; and sprinkled with blood the
  ground which showed them to the serene gales of the air. And thee, sprung
  of old from our ancestor Io, Epaphus, O progeny of Jove, on thee have I
  called, have I called in a foreign tongue, with prayers in foreign
  accent, come, come to this land (thy descendants have founded it), where
  the two Goddesses Proserpine and the dear Goddess Ceres, queen of all
  (since earth nurtures all things), have held their possessions, send the
  fire-bearing Goddesses to defend this land: since every thing is easy to
  the Gods.</p>

<p class="center">ETEOCLES, CHORUS, MESSENGER.</p>

  <p>ETEO. Go thou, and bring hither Creon son of Men&#339;ceus, the
  brother of my mother Jocasta, saying this, that I wish to communicate
  with him counsels of a private nature and those which concern the common
  welfare of the country, before we go into battle and the ranks of war.
  And see, he spares the trouble of your steps, by his presence; for I see
  him coming toward my palace.</p>

<p class="center">CREON, ETEOCLES, CHORUS.</p>

  <p>CRE. Surely have I visited many places, desiring to see you, O king
  Eteocles! and I have gone round to the gates and the guards of the
  Thebans, seeking you.</p>

  <p>ETEO. And indeed I have wished to see you, Creon, for I found attempts
  at reconciliation altogether fail when I came and entered into conference
  with Polynices.</p>

  <p>CRE. I have heard that he aspires to higher thoughts than Thebes,
  having trusted in his alliance with Adrastus and his army. But it becomes
  us to hold these things in dependence on the Gods. But what is most
  immediately before us, this am I come to acquaint you with.</p>

  <p>ETEO. What is this? for I understand not your speech.</p>

  <p>CRE. A prisoner is arrived from the Argives.</p>

  <p>ETEO. Does he bring us any news of those stationed there?</p>

  <p>CRE. The Argive army is preparing quickly to surround the city of the
  Thebans with thickly-ranged arms.(Note <a name="Phoen_B"></a><a
  href="#PhoenN_B">[B]</a>.)</p>

  <p>ETEO. Therefore must we draw our forces out of the Theban city.</p>

  <p>CRE. Whither? Dost thou not in the impetuosity of youth see what it
  behooves thee to see?</p>

  <p>ETEO. Without these trenches, as we are quickly about to fight.</p>

  <p>CRE. Small are the forces of this land; but theirs innumerable.</p>

  <p>ETEO. I know that they are bold in words.</p>

  <p>CRE. Argos of the Greeks has some renown.</p>

  <p>ETEO. Be confident; quickly will I fill the plain with their
  slaughter.</p>

  <p>CRE. I would it were so: but this I see is a work of much labor.</p>

  <p>ETEO. Know that I will not restrain my forces within the walls.</p>

  <p>CRE. And yet the whole of victory is prudence.</p>

  <p>ETEO. Dost thou wish then that I have recourse to other measures?</p>

  <p>CRE. To every measure indeed, rather than hazard all on one
  battle.</p>

  <p>ETEO. What if we were to attack them by night from ambush?</p>

  <p>CRE. If, having failed, at least you can have a safe retreat
  hither.</p>

  <p>ETEO. Night brings the same advantage to all, but more to the
  daring.</p>

  <p>CRE. Dreadful is it to fail in the darkness of night.</p>

  <p>ETEO. But shall I lead my force against them while at their meal?</p>

  <p>CRE. That would cause terror; but we must conquer.</p>

  <p>ETEO. The ford of Dirce is indeed deep to pass.</p>

  <p>CRE. Every thing is inferior to a good guard.</p>

  <p>ETEO. What then, shall I charge the Argive army with my cavalry?</p>

  <p>CRE. And there the army is fenced round with chariots.</p>

  <p>ETEO. What then shall I do? give up the city to the enemy?</p>

  <p>CRE. By no means; but deliberate if thou art wise.</p>

  <p>ETEO. What more prudent forethought is there?</p>

  <p>CRE. They say that they have seven men, as I have heard.</p>

  <p>ETEO. What have they been commanded to do? for their strength is
  small.</p>

  <p>CRE. To head their bands, to besiege the seven gates.</p>

  <p>ETEO. What then shall we do? I will not wait this indecision.</p>

  <p>CRE. Do thou thyself also choose seven men for the gates.</p>

  <p>ETEO. To head divisions, or for single combat?</p>

  <p>CRE. To head divisions, having selected the bravest.</p>

  <p>ETEO. I understand you; to guard the approach to the walls.</p>

  <p>CRE. And with them other generals; one man sees not every thing?</p>

  <p>ETEO. Having chosen them for boldness, or prudence in judgment?</p>

  <p>CRE. For both; for one without the other availeth nothing.</p>

  <p>ETEO. It shall be so: and having gone to the city of the seven towers,
  I will appoint chiefs at the gates, as you advise, having opposed equal
  champions against equal foes. But to mention the name of each would be a
  great delay, the enemy encamped under our very walls. But I will go, that
  I may not be idle with my hand. And may it befall me to find my brother
  opposed to me, and being joined with me in battle, to take him with my
  spear, [and to slay him, who came to desolate my country.] But it is thy
  duty to attend to the marriage of my sister Antigone and thy son Hæmon,
  if I fail aught of success; but the firm vow made before I now confirm at
  my going out. Thou art my mother's brother, why need I use more words?
  Treat her worthily, both for thine own and my sake. But my father incurs
  the punishment of the rashness he brought upon himself, having quenched
  his sight; I praise him not; even us will he put to death with his
  execrations, should he gain his point. But one thing is left undone by
  us, if the soothsayer Tiresias have any oracle to deliver, to enquire
  this of him; but I will send thy son, Creon, Men&#339;ceus, of the same
  name with thy father, to bring Tiresias hither. With pleasure will he
  enter into conversation with you; but I lately reviled him with his
  divining art, so that he is offended with me. But this charge I give the
  city with thee, Creon; if my arms should conquer, that the body of
  Polynices be never buried in this Theban land; but that the man who
  buries him shall die, although he be a friend. This I have told you: but
  my attendants I tell, bring out my arms, and my panoply which covers me,
  that we may go this appointed contest of the spear with victorious
  justice. But to Caution, the most valued of the Goddesses, will we
  address our prayers to preserve this city.</p>

<p class="center">CHORUS.</p>

  <p>O Mars, cause of infinite woe, why, I pray, art thou so possessed with
  blood and death, so discordant with the revels of Bacchus? Thou dost not
  in the circle of beautiful dancers in the bloom of youth, having let flow
  thy hair,<a name="Phoen_29"></a><a href="#PhoenN_29"><sup>[29]</sup></a>
  on the breath of the flute modulate strains, in which there is a lovely
  power to renew the dance. But with thy armed men, having excited the army
  of Argives against Thebes with blood, thou dancest before the city in a
  most inharmonious revel, thou movest not thy foot maddened by the thyrsus
  clad in fawn-skins, but thy solid-hoofed steed with thy chariot and
  horses' bits; and bounding at the streams of Ismenus, thou art borne
  rapidly in the chariot-course, having excited against the race of those
  sown [by Cadmus,] a raging host that grasp the shield, well armed,
  adverse to us at the walls of stone: surely Discord is some dreadful
  Goddess, who devised all these calamities against the princes of this
  land, the Labdacidæ involved in woe. O thou forest of heavenly foliage,
  most productive of beasts, thou snowy eye of Diana, Cithæron, never
  oughtest thou to have nourished him doomed to death, the son of Jocasta,
  &#338;dipus, the babe who was cast out from his home, marked by the
  golden clasps. Neither ought that winged virgin the Sphinx, thou mountain
  monster, that grief to this land, to have come, with her most
  inharmonious lays; who formerly approaching our walls, bore in her four
  talons the descendants of Cadmus to the inaccessible light of heaven,
  whom the infernal Pluto sends against the Thebans; but other ill-fated
  discord among the children of &#338;dipus springs up in the palace and in
  the city. For that which is not honorable, never can be honorable, as
  neither can children the unhallowed offspring of the mother, the
  pollution of the father. But she came to a kindred bed. Thou didst
  produce, O [Theban] land! thou didst produce formerly (as I heard the
  foreign report,<a name="Phoen_30"></a><a
  href="#PhoenN_30"><sup>[30]</sup></a> I heard it formerly at home), the
  race sprung from teeth from the fiery-crested dragon fed on beasts, the
  proudest honor of Thebes. But to the nuptials of Harmonia the Gods came
  of old, and by the harp and by the lyre of Amphion uprose the walls of
  Thebes the tower of the double streams,<a name="Phoen_31"></a><a
  href="#PhoenN_31"><sup>[31]</sup></a> at the midst of the pass of Dirce,
  which waters the verdant plain before Ismenus. And Io, our ancient
  mother, doomed to bear horns, brought forth a line of Theban kings. But
  this city receiving ten thousand goods one in change for another, hath
  stood in the highest chaplets of war.</p>

<p class="center">TIRESIAS (<i>led by his daughter</i>), MEN&#338;CEUS, CREON, CHORUS.</p>

  <p>TIR. Lead onward, my daughter, since thou art an eye to my blind
  steps, as the star to the mariners. Placing my steps hither on this level
  plain, proceed lest we stumble; thy father is feeble; and preserve
  carefully in thy virgin hand my calculations which I took, having learned
  the auguries of the birds, sitting in the sacred seats where I fortell
  the future. My child, Men&#339;ceus, son of Creon, tell me, how far is
  the remainder of the journey through the city to thy father? Since my
  knees are weary, and with difficulty I accomplish such a long
  journey.</p>

  <p>CRE. Be of good cheer; for thou hast steered thy foot, Tiresias, near
  to thy friends; but take hold of him, my son. Since every chariot,<a
  name="Phoen_32"></a><a href="#PhoenN_32"><sup>[32]</sup></a> and the foot
  of the aged man is used to expect the assistance of another's hand.</p>

  <p>TIR. Well: I am present; but why didst thou call me with such haste,
  Creon?</p>

  <p>CRE. We have not as yet forgotten: but recover thy strength, and
  collect thy breath, having thrown aside the fatigue occasioned by the
  journey.</p>

  <p>TIR. I am relaxed indeed<a name="Phoen_32a"></a><a
  href="#PhoenN_32a"><sup>[32a]</sup></a> with toil, brought hither from
  the Athenians the day before this. For there also was a contest of the
  spear with Eumolpus, where I made the descendants of Cecrops splendid
  conquerors. And I wear this golden chaplet, as thou seest, having
  received the first-fruits of the spoil of the enemy.</p>

  <p>CRE. Thy victorious garlands I make a happy omen. For we, as thou well
  knowest, are tossing in a storm of war with the Greeks, and great is the
  hazard of Thebes. The king Eteocles has therefore gone forth adorned with
  his armor already to battle with the Argives. But to me has he sent that
  I might learn from you, by doing what we should be most likely to
  preserve the city.</p>

  <p>TRE. For Eteocles' sake indeed I would have stopped my mouth, and
  repressed the oracles, but to thee, since thou desirest to know them,
  will I declare them: for this land labors under the malady of old, O
  Creon, from the time when Laïus became the father of children in spite of
  the Gods, and begat the wretched &#338;dipus, a husband for his mother.
  But the cruel lacerations of his eyes were in the wisdom of the Gods, and
  a warning to Greece. Which things the sons of &#338;dipus seeking to
  conceal among themselves by the lapse of time, as about forsooth to
  escape from the Gods, erred through their ignorance, for they neither
  giving the honor due to their father, nor allowing him a free liberty,
  infuriated the unfortunate man: and he breathed out against them dreadful
  threats, being both in affliction, and moreover dishonored. And I, what
  things omitting to do, and what words omitting to speak on the subject,
  have nevertheless fallen into the hatred of the sons of &#338;dipus? But
  death from their mutual hands is near them, O Creon. And many corses
  fallen around corses, having mingled the weapons of Argos and Thebes,
  shall cause bitter lamentations to the Theban land. And thou, O wretched
  city, art sapped from thy foundations, unless men will obey my words. For
  this were the first thing, that not any of the family of &#338;dipus
  should be citizens, nor king of the territory, inasmuch as they are
  possessed by demons, and are they that will overthrow the city. And since
  the evil triumphs over the good, there is one other thing requisite to
  insure preservation. But, as this is neither safe for me to say, and
  distressing to those on whom the lot has fallen, to give to the city the
  balm of preservation, I will depart: farewell; for being an individual
  with many shall I suffer what is about to happen if it must be so; for
  what can I do!<a name="Phoen_33"></a><a

  <p>TIR. Thy fortune flies thee, but not I.</p>

  <p>CRE. Tell me the means of preserving the citizens and their city.</p>

  <p>TRE. Thou wishest now indeed, and soon thou wilt not wish.</p>

  <p>TIR. Art thou willing then to hear, and art thou eager?</p>

  <p>TIR. Hear now then my prophecies.&mdash;But this first I wish to
  ascertain clearly, where is Men&#339;ceus who brought me hither.</p>

  <p>CRE. He is not far off, but close to thee.</p>

  <p>TIR. Let him depart then afar from my oracles.</p>

  <p>TIR. Hear now then the tenor of my oracles; what things doing ye may
  preserve the city of the Cadmeans. It is necessary for thee to sacrifice
  this thy son Men&#339;ceus for the country, since thou thyself callest
  for this fortune.</p>

  It is necessary that he, stabbed in that cave where the earth-born dragon
  lay, the guardian of Dirce's fountain, give his gory blood a libation to
  the earth on account of the ancient wrath of Mars against Cadmus, who
  avenges the slaughter of the earth-born dragon; and these things done, ye
  shall obtain Mars as your ally. But if the earth receive fruit in return
  for fruit, and mortal blood in return for blood, ye shall have that land
  propitious, which formerly sent forth a crop of men from seed armed with
  golden helmets; but there must of this race die one, who is the son of
  the dragon's jaw. But thou art left among us of the race of those sown
  men, pure in thy descent, both by thy mother's side and in the male line;
  and thy children too: Hæmon's marriage however precludes his being slain,
  for he is not a youth, [for, although he has not approached her bed, he
  has yet contracted the marriage.] But this youth, devoted to this city,
  by dying may preserve his native country. And he will cause a bitter
  return to Adrastus and the Argives, casting back death over their eyes,
  and Thebes will he make illustrious: of these two fates choose the one;
  either preserve thy child or the state. Every information from me thou
  hast:&mdash;lead me, my child, toward home;&mdash;but whoever exercises
  the art of divination, is a fool; if indeed he chance to show
  disagreeable things, he is rendered hateful to those to whom he may
  prophesy; but speaking falsely to his employers from motives of pity, he
  is unjust as touching the Gods.&mdash;Ph&#339;bus alone should speak in
  oracles to men, who fears nobody.</p>

<p class="center">CREON, MEN&#338;CEUS, CHORUS.</p>

  <p>CHOR. Creon, why art thou mute compressing thy voice in silence, for
  to me also there is no less consternation.</p>

  <p>CRE. But what can one say?&mdash;It is clear however what my answer
  will be. For never will I go to this degree of calamity, to expose my son
  a victim for the state. For all men live with an affection toward their
  children, nor would any give up his own child to die. Let no one praise
  me for the deed, and slay my children. But I myself, for I am arrived at
  a mature period of life, am ready to die to liberate my country. But
  haste, my son, before the whole city hears it, disregarding the
  intemperate oracles of prophets, fly as quickly as possible, having
  quitted this land. For he will tell these things to the authorities and
  chiefs, going to the seven gates, and to the officers: and if indeed we
  get before him, there is safety for thee, but if thou art too late, we
  are undone, thou diest.</p>

  salute<a name="Phoen_34"></a><a href="#PhoenN_34"><sup>[34]</sup></a> thy
  sister, whose breast I first sucked, Jocasta I mean, deprived of my
  mother, and reft from her, an orphan, I will depart and save my life. But
  haste, go, let not thy purpose be hindered.</p>

<p class="center">MEN&#338;CEUS, CHORUS.</p>

  <p>MEN. Ye females, how well removed I my father's fears, having deceived
  him with words, in order to gain my wishes; who sends me out of the way,
  depriving the city of its good fortune, and gives me up to cowardice. And
  these things are pardonable indeed in an old man, but in my case it
  deserves no pardon to become the deserter of that country which gave me
  birth. That ye may know then, I will go, and preserve the city, and will
  give up my life for this land. For it is a disgraceful thing, that those
  indeed who are free from the oracle, and are not concerned with any
  compulsion of the Gods, standing at their shields in battle, shall not be
  slow to die fighting before the towers for their country; and I, having
  betrayed my father, and my brother, and my own city, shall depart
  coward-like from out of the land; but wherever I live, I shall appear
  vile. No: by that Jove that dwelleth amidst the constellations, and
  sanguinary Mars, who set up those sown men, who erst sprung from the
  earth, to be kings of this country. But I will depart, and standing on
  the summit of the battlements, stabbing myself over the dark deep lair of
  the dragon, where the prophet appointed, will give liberty to the
  country&mdash;the word has been spoken. But I go, by my death about to
  give no mean gift to the state, and will rid this land of its affliction.
  For if every one, seizing what opportunity he had in his power of doing
  good, would persist in it, and bring it forward for his country's weal,
  states, experiencing fewer calamities, henceforward might be
  prosperous.</p>

  <p>CHOR. Thou camest forth, thou camest forth, O winged monster,
  production of the earth, and the viper of hell, the ravager of the
  Cadmeans, big with destruction, big with woes, in form half-virgin, a
  hostile prodigy, with thy ravening wings, and thy talons that preyed on
  raw flesh, who erst from Dirce's spot bearing aloft the youths,
  accompanied by an inharmonious lay, thou broughtest, thou broughtest
  cruel woes to our country; cruel was he of the Gods, whoever was the
  author of these things. And the moans of the matrons, and the moans of
  the virgins, resounded in the house, in a voice, in a strain of misery,
  they lamented some one thing, some another, in succession through the
  city. And the groaning and the noise was like to thunder, when the winged
  virgin bore out of sight any man from the city. But at length came by the
  mission of the Pythian oracle &#338;dipus the unhappy to this land of
  Thebes, to us then indeed delighted, but again came woes. For he,
  wretched man, having gained the glorious victory over the enigmas,
  contracts a marriage, an unfortunate marriage with his mother, and
  pollutes the city. And fresh woes does the unfortunate man cause to
  succeed with slaughter, devoting by curses his sons to the unhallowed
  contest.&mdash;With admiration, with admiration we look on him, who is
  gone to kill himself for the sake of his country's land; to Creon indeed
  having left lamentations, but about to make the seven-towered gates of
  the land greatly victorious. Thus may we be mothers, thus may we be blest
  in our children, O dear Pallas, who destroyedst the blood of the dragon
  by the hurled stone, driving the attention of Cadmus to the action,
  whence with rapine some fiend of the Gods rushed on this land.</p>

<p class="center">MESSENGER, JOCASTA, CHORUS.</p>

  <p>MESS. Ho there! who is at the gate of the palace? Open, conduct
  Jocasta from out of the house.&mdash;What ho! again&mdash;after a long
  time indeed, but yet come forth, hear, O renowned wife of &#338;dipus,
  ceasing from thy lamentations, and thy tears of grief.</p>

  <p>JOC. O most dear man, surely thou comest bearing the news of some
  calamity, of the death of Eteocles, by whose shield thou always didst go,
  warding off the weapons of the enemy. What new message, I pray, dost thou
  come to deliver? Is my son dead or alive? Tell me.</p>

  <p>MESS. He lives, be not alarmed for this, for I will rid thee of this
  fear.</p>

  <p>JOC. But what? In what state are our seven-towered ramparts?</p>

  <p>MESS. They stand unshaken, nor is the city destroyed.</p>

  <p>JOC. Come they in danger from the spear of Argos?</p>

  <p>MESS. To the very extreme of danger; but the arms of Thebes came off
  superior to the Mycenæan spear.</p>

  <p>JOC. Tell me one thing, by the Gods, whether thou knowest any thing of
  Polynices (since this is a concern to me also) whether he sees the
  light.</p>

  <p>MESS. Thus far in the day thy pair of children lives.</p>

  <p>JOC. Be thou blest. But how did ye stationed on the towers drive off
  the spear of Argos from the gates? Tell me, that I may go and delight the
  old blind man in the house with the news of his country's being
  preserved.</p>

  <p>MESS. After that the son of Creon, he that died for the land, standing
  on the summit of the towers, plunged the black-handled sword into his
  throat, the salvation of this land, thy son placed seven cohorts, and
  their leaders with them, at the seven gates, guards against the Argive
  spear; and he drew up the horse ready to support the horse, and the
  heavy-armed men to reinforce the shield-bearers, so that to the part of
  the wall which was in danger there might be succor at hand. But from the
  lofty citadel we view the army of the Argives with their white shields,
  having quitted Tumessus and now come near the trench, at full speed they
  reached the city of the land of Cadmus. And the pæan and the trumpets at
  the same time from them resounded, and off the walls from us. And first
  indeed Parthenopæus the son of the huntress (<i>Atalanta</i>) led his
  division horrent with their thick shields against the Neïtan<a
  name="Phoen_35"></a><a href="#PhoenN_35"><sup>[35]</sup></a> gate, having
  a family device in the middle of his shield, Atalanta destroying the
  Ætolian boar with her distant-wounding bow. And against the Prætan gate
  marched the prophet Amphiaraüs, having victims in his car, not bearing an
  insolent emblem, but modestly having his arms without a device. But
  against the Ogygian gate stood Prince Hippomedon, bearing an emblem in
  the middle of his shield, the Argus gazing with his spangled<a
  name="Phoen_36"></a><a href="#PhoenN_36"><sup>[36]</sup></a> eyes, [some
  eyes indeed with the rising of the stars awake,<a name="Phoen_37"></a><a
  href="#PhoenN_37"><sup>[37]</sup></a> and some with the setting closed,
  as we had the opportunity of seeing afterward when he was dead.] But
  Tydeus was drawn up at the Homoloïan gate, having on his shield a lion's
  skin rough with his mane, but in his right hand he bore a torch, as the
  Titan Prometheus,<a name="Phoen_38"></a><a
  href="#PhoenN_38"><sup>[38]</sup></a> intent on firing the city. But thy
  son Polynices drew up his array at the Crenean gate; but the swift
  Potnian mares, the emblem on his shield, were starting through fright,
  well circularly<a name="Phoen_39"></a><a
  href="#PhoenN_39"><sup>[39]</sup></a> grouped within <i>the orb</i> at
  the handle of the shield, so that they seemed infuriated. But Capaneus,
  not holding less notions than Mars on the approaching battle, drew up his
  division against the Electran gate. Upon the iron embossments of his
  shield was an earth-born giant bearing upon his shoulders a whole city,
  which he had torn up from the foundations with bars, an intimation to us
  what our city should suffer. But at the seventh gate was Adrastus, having
  his shield filled with a hundred vipers, bearing on his left arm a
  representation of the hydra, the boast of Argos, and from the midst of
  the walls the dragons were bearing the children of the Thebans in their
  jaws. But I had the opportunity of seeing each of these, as I took the
  word of battle to the leaders of the divisions. And first indeed we
  fought with bows, and javelins, and distant-wounding slings, and
  fragments of rocks; but when we were conquering in the fight, Tydeus
  shouted out, and thy son on a sudden, "O sons of the Danaï, why delay we,
  ere we are galled with their missile weapons, to make a rush at the gates
  all in a body, light-armed men, horsemen, and those who drive the
  chariots?" And when they heard the cry, no one was backward; but many
  fell, their heads besmeared with blood; of us also you might have seen
  before the walls frequent divers toppling to the ground; and they
  moistened the parched earth with streams of blood. But the Arcadian, no
  Argive, the son of Atalanta, as some whirlwind falling on the gates,
  calls out for fire and a spade, as though he would dig up the city. But
  Periclymenus the son of the God of the Ocean stopped him in his raging,
  hurling at his head a stone, a wagon-load, a pinnacle<a
  name="Phoen_40"></a><a href="#PhoenN_40"><sup>[40]</sup></a> <i>rent</i>
  from the battlement; and dashed in pieces his head with its auburn hair,
  and crushed the suture of the bones, and besmeared with blood his lately
  blooming cheeks; nor shall he carry back his living form to his mother,
  glorious in her bow, the daughter of Mænalus. But when thy son saw this
  gate was in a state of safety, he went to another, and I followed. But I
  see Tydeus, and many armed with shields around him, darting with their
  Ætolian lances at the highest battlements of the towers, so that our men
  put to flight quitted the heights of the ramparts; but thy son, as a
  hunter, collects them together again; and posted them a second time on
  the towers; and we hasten on to another gate, having relieved the
  distress in this quarter. But Capaneus, how can I express the measure of
  his rage! For he came bearing the ranges of a long-reaching ladder, and
  made this high boast, "That not even the hallowed fire of Jove should
  hinder him from taking the city from its highest turrets." And these
  things soon as he had proclaimed, though assailed with stones, he
  clambered up, having contracted his body under his shield, climbing the
  slippery footing of the bars<a name="Phoen_41"></a><a
  href="#PhoenN_41"><sup>[41]</sup></a> of the ladder: but when he was now
  mounting the battlements of the walls Jupiter strikes him with his
  thunder; and the earth resounded, insomuch that all trembled; and his
  limbs were hurled, as it were by a sling, from the ladder separately from
  one another, his hair to heaven, and his blood to the ground, and his
  limbs, like the whirling of Ixion on his wheel, were carried round; and
  his scorched body falls to the earth. But when Adrastus saw that Jove was
  hostile to his army, he stationed the host of the Argives without the
  trench. But ours on the contrary, when they saw the auspicious sign from
  Jove, drove out their chariots, horsemen and heavy-armed, and rushing
  into the midst of the Argive arms engaged in fight: and there were all
  the sorts of misery together: they died, they fell from their chariots,
  and the wheels leaped up and axles upon axles: and corses were heaped
  together with corses.&mdash;We have preserved then our towers from being
  overthrown to this present day; but whether for the future this land will
  be prosperous, rests with the Gods.</p>

  <p>CHOR. To conquer is glorious; but if the Gods have the better intent,
  may I be fortunate!</p>

  <p>JOC. Well are the ways of the Gods, and of fortune; for my children
  live, and my country has escaped; but the unhappy Creon seems to feel the
  effects of my marriage, and of &#338;dipus's misfortunes, being deprived
  of his child; for the state indeed, happily, but individually, to his
  misery: but recount to me again, what after this did my two sons purpose
  to do?</p>

  <p>MESS. Forbear the rest; for in every circumstance hitherto thou art
  fortunate.</p>

  <p>JOC. This hast thou said so as to raise suspicion; I must not
  forbear.</p>

  <p>MESS. Dost thou want any thing more than that thy sons are safe?</p>

  <p>JOC. In what follows also I would hear if I am fortunate.</p>

  <p>MESS. Let me go: thy son is deprived of his armor-bearer.</p>

  <p>JOC. Thou concealest some ill and coverest it in obscurity.</p>

  <p>MESS. I can not speak thy ills after thy happiness.</p>

  <p>JOC. <i>But thou shalt</i>, unless fleeing from me thou fleest through
  the air.</p>

  <p>MESS. Alas! alas! Why dost thou not suffer me to depart after a
  message of glad tidings, but forcest me to tell calamities?&mdash;Thy
  sons are intent on most shameful deeds of boldness&mdash;to engage in
  single combat apart from the whole army, having addressed to the Argives
  and Thebans in common a speech, such as they never ought to have spoken.
  But Eteocles began, standing on the lofty turret, having commanded to
  proclaim silence to the army. And he said, "O generals of the Grecian
  land, and chieftains of the Danaï, who have come hither, and O people of
  Cadmus, neither for the sake of Polynices barter your lives, nor for my
  cause. For I myself, taking this danger on myself, alone will enter the
  lists with my brother; and if indeed I slay him, I will dwell in the
  palace alone; but should I be subdued, I will give it up to him alone.
  But you, ceasing from the combat, O Argives, shall return to your land,
  not leaving your lives here; [of the Theban people also there is enough
  that lieth dead,"] Thus much he spake; but thy son Polynices rushed from
  the ranks, and approved his words. But all the Argives murmured their
  applause, and the people of Cadmus, as thinking this plan just. And after
  this the generals made a truce, and in the space between the two armies
  pledged an oath to abide by it. And now the two sons of the aged
  &#338;dipus clad their bodies in an entire suit of brazen armor. And
  their friends adorned them, the champion of this land indeed the
  chieftains of the Thebans; and him the principal men of the Danaï. And
  they stood resplendent, and they changed not their color, raging to let
  forth their spears at each other. But their friends on either side as
  they passed by encouraging them with words, thus spoke. "Polynices, it
  rests with thee to erect the statue of Jove, emblem of victory, and to
  confer a glorious fame on Argos." But to Eteocles on the other hand; "Now
  thou fightest for the state, now if thou come off victorious, thou art in
  possession of the sceptre." These things they said exhorting them to the
  combat. But the seers sacrificed the sheep, and scrutinized the shooting
  of the flames, and the bursting <i>of the gall</i>, the moisture
  adverse<a name="Phoen_42"></a><a href="#PhoenN_42"><sup>[42]</sup></a>
  <i>to the fire</i>, and the extremity of the flame, which bears a
  two-fold import, both the sign of victory,<a name="Phoen_43"></a><a
  href="#PhoenN_43"><sup>[43]</sup></a> and the sign of being defeated.<a
  name="Phoen_44"></a><a href="#PhoenN_44"><sup>[44]</sup></a> But if thou
  hast any power, or words of wisdom, or the soothing charms of
  incantation, go, stay thy children from the fearful combat, since great
  the danger, [and dreadful will be the sequel of the contest,
  <i>namely</i>, tears for thee, deprived this day of thy two
  children.]</p>

  <p>JOC. O my child, Antigone, come forth from before the palace; the
  state of thy fortune suits not now the dance, nor the virgin's chamber,
  but it is thy duty, in conjunction with thy mother, to hinder two
  excellent men, and thy brothers verging toward death from falling by each
  other's hands.</p>

  <p>Alas! alas! shuddering with horror, shuddering is my breast; and
  through my flesh came pity, pity for the unhappy mother, on account of
  her two children, whether of them then will distain with blood the other
  (alas me for my sufferings, O Jove, O earth), the own brother's neck, the
  own brother's life, in arms, in slaughter? Wretched, wretched I, over
  which corse then shall I raise the lamentation for the dead? O earth,
  earth, the two beasts of prey, blood-thirsty souls, brandishing the
  spear, will quickly distain with blood the fallen, fallen enemy.
  Wretches, that they ever came to the thought of a single combat! In a
  foreign strain will I mourn with tears my elegy of groans due to the
  dead. Destiny is at hand&mdash;death is near; this day will decide the
  event. Ill-fated, ill-fated murder because of the Furies! But I see Creon
  here with clouded brow advancing toward the house, I will cease therefore
  from the groans I am uttering.</p>

<p class="center">CREON, CHORUS.</p>

  <p>CRE. Ah me! what shall I do? whether am I to groan in weeping myself,
  or the city, which a cloud of such magnitude encircles as to cast us
  amidst the gloom of Acheron? For my son has perished having died for the
  city, having achieved a glorious name, but to me a name of sorrow. Him
  having taken just now from the dragon's den, stabbed by his own hand, I
  wretched bore in my arms; and the whole house resounds with shrieks; but
  I, myself aged, am come after my aged sister Jocasta, that she may wash
  and lay out my son now no more. For it behooves the living well to revere
  the God below by paying honors to the dead.</p>

  <p>MESS. O wretched me! what language or what words can I utter? we are
  undone&mdash;</p>

  <p>CRE. Thou beginnest thy speech with no promising prelude.</p>

  <p>MESS. Oh wretched me! doubly do I lament, for I hear great
  calamities.</p>

  <p>CRE. In addition to the calamities that have happened dost thou still
  speak of others?</p>

  <p>MESS. Thy sister's sons, O Creon, no longer behold the light.</p>

  <p>CRE. Ah! alas! thou utterest great ills to me and to the state.</p>

  <p>MESS. O mansions of &#338;dipus, do ye hear these things of thy
  children who have perished by similar fates?</p>

  <p>CHOR. Ay, so that, had they but sense, they would weep.</p>

  <p>CRE. O most heavy misery! Oh me wretched with woes! alas! unhappy
  me!</p>

  <p>MESS. If that thou knewest the evils yet in addition to these.</p>

  <p>CRE. And how can there be more fatal ills than these?</p>

  <p>MESS. Thy sister is dead with her two children.</p>

  <p>CHOR. Raise, raise the cry of woe, and smite your heads with the blows
  of your white hands.</p>

  <p>CRE. Oh unhappy Jocasta, what an end of thy life and of thy marriage
  hast thou endured in the riddles of the Sphinx!<a name="Phoen_45"></a><a
  href="#PhoenN_45"><sup>[45]</sup></a> But how took place the slaughter of
  her two sons, and the combat arising from the curse of &#338;dipus? tell
  me.</p>

  <p>MESS. The success of the country before the towers indeed thou
  knowest; for the circuit of the wall is not of such vast extent, but that
  thou must know all that has taken place. But after that the sons of the
  aged &#338;dipus had clad their limbs in brazen armor, they came and
  stood in the midst of the plain between the two armies, ready for the
  contest, and the fierceness of the single battle. And having cast a look
  toward Argos, Polynices uttered his prayer; "O venerable Juno (for I am
  thine, since in marriage I joined myself with the daughter of Adrastus,
  and dwell in that land), grant me to slay my brother, and to cover with
  blood my hostile hand bearing the victory." And Eteocles looking at the
  temple of Pallas, glorious in her golden shield, prayed; "O Daughter of
  Jove, grant me with my hand to hurl my victorious spear from this arm
  home to the breast of my brother, [and slay him who came to lay waste my
  country."] And when the sound of the Tuscan trumpet was raised, as the
  torch, the signal for the fierce battle, they sped with dreadful rush
  toward each other; and like wild boars whetting their savage tusks, they
  met, their cheeks all moist with foam; and they rushed forward with their
  lances; but they couched beneath the orbs of their shields, in order that
  the steel might fall harmless. But if either perceived the other's eye
  raised above the verge, he drove the lance at his face, intent to be
  beforehand with him: but dexterously they shifted their eyes to the open
  ornaments of their shields, so that the spear was made of none effect.
  And more sweat trickled down the spectators than the combatants, through
  the fear of their friends. But Eteocles, stumbling with his foot against
  a stone, which rolled under his tread,<a name="Phoen_46"></a><a
  href="#PhoenN_46"><sup>[46]</sup></a> places his limb without the shield.
  But Polynices ran up with his spear, when he saw a stroke open to his
  steel, and the Argive spear passed through the shank. And all the host of
  the Danaï shouted for joy. And the hero who first was wounded, when he
  perceived his shoulder exposed in this effort, pierced the breast of
  Polynices with his lance, and gave joy to the citizens of Cadmus, but he
  broke the point of his spear. But being come to a strait for a spear, he
  retreated backward on his leg, and taking a stone of marble, he hurled it
  and crashed <i>his antagonist's</i> spear in the middle: and the battle
  was on equal terms, both being deprived of the spear in their hands. Then
  seizing the handles of their swords they met at close quarters, and, as
  they clashed their shields together, raised a great tumult of battle
  around them. And Eteocles having a sort of idea of its success, made use
  of a Thessalian stratagem, <i>which he had learned</i> from his
  connection with that country. For giving up his present mode of attack,
  he brings his left foot behind, protecting well the pit of his own
  stomach; and stepping forward his right leg, he plunged the sword through
  the navel, and drove it to the vertebræ. But the unhappy Polynices
  bending together his side and his bowels falls weltering in blood. But
  the other, as he were now the victor, and had subdued him in the fight,
  casting his sword on the ground, went to spoil him, not fixing his
  attention on himself, but on that his purpose. Which thing also deceived
  him; for Polynices, he that fell first, still breathing a little,
  preserving his sword e'en in his deathly fall, with difficulty indeed,
  but he did stretch his sword to the heart of Eteocles. And holding the
  dust in their gripe they both fall near one another, and determined not
  the victory.</p>

  <p>CHOR. Alas! alas! to what degree, O &#338;dipus, do I groan for thy
  misfortunes! but the God seems to have fulfilled thy imprecations.</p>

  <p>MESS. Hear now then woes even in addition to these&mdash;For when her
  sons having fallen were breathing their last, at this moment the wretched
  mother rushes before them, and when she perceived them stricken with
  mortal wounds she shrieked out, "Oh my sons, I am come too late a
  succor:" and throwing herself by the side of her children in turn, she
  wept, she lamented with moans her long anxiety in suckling them <i>now
  lost</i>: and their sister, who accompanied to stand by her in her
  misery, at the same time <i>broke forth</i>; "O supporters of my mother's
  age! Oh ye that have betrayed my hopes of marriage, my dearest
  brothers!"&mdash;But king Eteocles heaving from his breast his gasping
  breath, heard his mother, and putting out his cold clammy hand, sent not
  forth indeed a voice; but from his eyes spoke her in tears to signify
  affection. But Polynices, who yet breathed, looking at his sister and his
  aged mother, thus spoke: "We perish, O my mother; but I grieve for thee,
  and for this my sister, and my brother who lies dead, for being my
  friend, he became my enemy, but still my friend.&mdash;But bury me, O
  mother of my being, and thou my sister, in my native land, and pacify the
  exasperated city, that I may obtain thus much at least of my country's
  land, although I have lost the palace. And close my eyelids with thy
  hand, my mother" (and he places it himself upon his eyes), "and fare ye
  well! for now darkness surroundeth me." And both breathed out their lives
  together. And the mother, when she saw what had taken place, beyond
  endurance grieving, snatched the sword from the dead body, and
  perpetrated a deed of horror; for she drove the steel through the middle
  of her throat, and lies dead on those most dear to her, having each in
  her arms embraced. But the people rose up hastily to a strife of
  opinions; we indeed, as holding, that my master was victorious; but they,
  that the other was; and there was also a contention between the generals,
  those on the other side <i>contended</i>, that Polynices first struck
  with the spear, but those on ours that there was no victory where the
  combatants died. [And in the mean time Antigone withdrew from the army;]
  but they rushed to arms; but fortunately by a sort of foresight the
  people of Cadmus had sat upon their shields: and we gained the advantage
  of falling on the Argives not yet accoutred in their arms. And no one
  made a stand, but flying they covered the plain; and immense quantities
  of blood were spilt of the corses that fell, but when we were victorious
  in the fight, some indeed raised the image of Jove emblem of victory, but
  some of us stripping the shields from the Argive corses sent the spoils
  within the city. But others with Antigone are bearing hither the dead for
  their friends to lament over. But these contests have in some respect
  turned out most happy for this state, but in other respect most
  unhappy.</p>

  <p>CHOR. No longer the misfortunes of the house come to our ears, we may
  also see before the palace these three fallen corses, who have shared the
  dark realms by a united death.</p>

<p class="center">[<i>The dead bodies borne</i>.]</p>

<p class="center">ANTIGONE, CREON, CHORUS.</p>

  <p>ANT. Not veiling the softness of my cheek on which my ringlets fall,
  nor caring for the purple glow of virginity under my lids, the blush of
  my countenance, I am borne along the bacchanal of the dead, rending the
  fillet from my hair, rejecting the saffron robe of delicateness, having
  the mournful office of conducting the dead. Alas! alas! woe is me! Oh
  Polynices, thou well answeredst to thy name! Alas me! Oh Thebes! but thy
  strife, no strife, but murder consummated with murder,<a
  name="Phoen_47"></a><a href="#PhoenN_47"><sup>[47]</sup></a> hath
  destroyed the house of &#338;dipus with dreadful, with mournful blood.
  But what groan responsive to my sufferings, or what lament of music shall
  I invoke to my tears, to my tears, O house, O house, bearing these three
  kindred bodies, my mother, and her children, the joy of the fury? who
  destroyed the entire house of &#338;dipus, what time intelligently<a
  name="Phoen_48"></a><a href="#PhoenN_48"><sup>[48]</sup></a> he unfolded
  the difficult song of the fierce monster, having thereby slain the body
  of the fierce musical Sphinx. Alas me! my father; what Grecian, or what
  Barbarian, or what other of the noble in birth, of mortal blood, in time
  of old ever bore such manifest sufferings of so many ills? Wretched I,
  how do I lament! What bird, sitting on the highest boughs of the oak or
  pine, will sing responsive to my lamentations, who have lost my mother?
  who weep the strain of grief in addition to these moans <i>for my
  brothers</i>, about to pass my long life in floods of tears.&mdash;Which
  shall I bewail? On which first shall I scatter the first offerings rent
  from my hair? On my mother's two breasts of milk, or upon the
  death-wounds of my two brothers? Alas! alas! Leave thine house, bringing
  thy sightless eye, O aged father, &#338;dipus, show thy wretched age, who
  within thy palace having poured the gloomy darkness over thine eyes,
  draggest on a long<a name="Phoen_49"></a><a
  href="#PhoenN_49"><sup>[49]</sup></a> life. Dost thou hear wandering in
  the hall,&mdash;resting thy aged foot upon the couch in a state of
  misery?</p>

<p class="center">&#338;DIPUS, CREON, ANTIGONE, CHORUS.</p>

  <p>&#338;D. Why, O virgin, hast thou with the most doleful tears called
  me forth leaning on the support of a blind foot<a name="Phoen_50"></a><a
  href="#PhoenN_50"><sup>[50]</sup></a> to the light, a bed-ridden man from
  his darksome chamber, gray-headed, an obscure phantom of air&mdash;a dead
  body beneath the earth&mdash;a flitting dream?</p>

  <p>ANT. O father, thou shalt receive words of unhappy tidings; no longer
  do thy children behold the light, nor thy wife, who ever was employed in
  attending as a staff on thy blind foot, my father: alas me!</p>

  <p>&#338;D. Alas me, for my sufferings! for well may I groan and
  vociferate these things. The three souls, tell me, my child, by what
  fate, how quitted they this light?</p>

  <p>ANT. Not for the sake of reproaching thee, nor exulting over thee, but
  for grief I speak: thy evil genius, heavy with swords, and fire, and
  wretched combats, has rushed down upon thy children, O my father.</p>

  <p>&#338;D. Alas me! ah! ah!</p>

  <p>ANT. Why dost thou thus groan?</p>

  <p>&#338;D. Alas me! my children!</p>

  <p>ANT. Thou wouldest grieve indeed, if looking on the chariot of the sun
  drawn by its four steeds, thou couldest direct the sight of thine eyes to
  these bodies of the dead.</p>

  <p>&#338;D. The evil of my sons indeed is manifest; but my wretched wife,
  by what fate, O my child, did she perish?</p>

  <p>ANT. Causing to all tears of grief they could not contain, to her
  children she bared her breast, a suppliant she bared it, holding it up in
  supplication. But the mother found her children at the Electran gate, in
  the mead where the lotus abounds, contending with their lances in the
  common war, as lions bred in the same cave, with the blood-wounds now a
  cold, a gory libation, which Plato received, and Mars gave. And having
  seized the brazen-wrought sword from the dead she plunged it into her
  flesh, but with grief for her children she fell amidst her children. But
  all these sufferings, O my father, has the God heaped this day upon our
  house, whoever he be, that adds this consummation.</p>

  <p>CHOR. This day hath been the beginning of many woes to the house of
  &#338;dipus; but may life be more fortunate!</p>

  <p>CRE. Now indeed cease from your grief, for it is time to think of the
  sepulture. But hear these words, O &#338;dipus; Eteocles, thy son, hath
  given to me the dominion of this land, giving them as a marriage portion
  to Hæmon, and <i>with them</i> the bed of thy daughter Antigone. I
  therefore will not suffer thee any longer to dwell in this land. For
  clearly did Tiresias say, that never, whilst thou dost inhabit this land,
  will the state be prosperous. But depart; and this I say not from
  insolence, nor being thine enemy, but on account of thy evil genius,
  fearing lest the country suffer any harm.</p>

  <p>&#338;D. O Fate, from the beginning how wretched [and unhappy] didst
  thou form me, [if ever other man was formed!] whom, even before I came
  into the light from my mother's womb, when yet unborn Apollo foretold
  that I should be the murderer of my father Laïus, alas! wretch that I am!
  And when I was born, again my father who gave me life, seeks to take my
  life, considering that I was born his enemy: for it was fated that he
  should die by my hands, and he sends me, poor wretch, as I craved the
  breast, a prey for the wild beasts: where I was preserved&mdash;for would
  that Cithæron, it ought, had sunk to the bottomless chasms of Tartarus,
  for that it did not destroy me; but the God fixed it my lot to serve
  under Polybus my master: but I unhappy man, having slain my own father,
  ascended the bed of my wretched mother, and begat children, my brothers,
  whom I destroyed, having received down the curse from Laïus, and given it
  to my sons. For I was not by nature so utterly devoid of understanding,
  as to have devised such things against my eyes, and against the life of
  my children, without the interference of some of the Gods.
  Well!&mdash;what then shall I ill-fated do? who will accompany me the
  guide of my dark steps? She that lies here dead! living, well know I, she
  would. But my noble pair of sons? I have no sons.&mdash;But still in my
  vigor can I myself procure my sustenance? Whence?&mdash;Why, O Creon,
  dost thou thus utterly kill me? for kill me thou wilt, if thou shalt cast
  me out of the land. Yet will I not appear base, stretching my hands
  around thy knees, for I can not belie my former nobleness, not even
  though my plight is miserable.</p>

  <p>CRE. Well has it been spoken by thee, that thou wilt not touch my
  knees, but I can not permit thee to dwell in the land. But of these
  corses, the one we must even now bear to the house; but the body of
  Polynices cast out unburied beyond the borders of this land. And these
  things shall be proclaimed to all the Thebans: "whoever shall be found
  either crowning the corse, or covering it with earth, shall receive death
  for his offense." But thou, ceasing from the groans for the three dead,
  retire, Antigone, within the house, and behave as beseems a virgin,
  expecting the approaching day in which the bed of Hæmon awaits thee.</p>

  <p>ANT. Oh father, in what a state of woes do we miserable beings lie!
  How do I lament for thee! more than for the dead! For it is not that one
  of thy ills is heavy, and the other not heavy, but thou art in all things
  unhappy, my father.&mdash;But thee I ask, our new lord, [wherefore dost
  thou insult my father here, banishing him from his country?] Why make thy
  laws against an unhappy corse?</p>

  <p>CRE. The determination of Eteocles this, not mine.</p>

  <p>ANT. It is absurd, and thou a fool to enforce it.</p>

  <p>CRE. How so? Is it not just to execute injunctions?</p>

  <p>ANT. No, if they are base, at least, and spoken with ill intent.</p>

  <p>CRE. What! will he not with justice be given to the dogs?</p>

  <p>ANT. <i>No</i>, for thus do ye not demand of him lawful justice.</p>

  <p>CRE. <i>We do</i>; since he was the enemy of the state, who least
  ought to be an enemy.</p>

  <p>ANT. Hath he not paid then his life to fortune?</p>

  <p>CRE. And in his burial too let him now satisfy vengeance.</p>

  <p>ANT. What outrage having committed, if he came after his share of the
  kingdom?</p>

  <p>CRE. This man, that you may know once for all, shall be unburied.</p>

  <p>ANT. I will bury him; even though the city forbid it.</p>

  <p>CRE. Thyself then wilt thou at the same time bury near the corse.</p>

  <p>ANT. But that is a glorious thing, for two friends to lie near.</p>

  <p>CRE. Lay hold of her, and bear her to the house.</p>

  <p>ANT. By no means&mdash;for I will not let go this body.</p>

  <p>CRE. The God has decreed it, O virgin, not as thou wilt.</p>

  <p>ANT. And this too is decreed&mdash;that the dead be not insulted.</p>

  <p>CRE. Around him none shall place the moist dust.</p>

  <p>ANT. Nay, by his mother here Jocasta, I entreat thee, Creon.</p>

  <p>CRE. Thou laborest in vain, for thou canst not obtain this.</p>

  <p>ANT. But suffer thou me at any rate to bathe the body.</p>

  <p>CRE. This would be one of the things forbidden by the state.</p>

  <p>ANT. But let me put bandages round his cruel wounds.</p>

  <p>CRE. In no way shalt thou show respect to this corse.</p>

  <p>ANT. Oh most dear, but I will at least kiss thy lips.</p>

  <p>CRE. Thou shalt not prepare calamity against thy wedding by thy
  lamentations.</p>

  <p>ANT. What! while I live shall I ever marry thy son?</p>

  <p>CRE. There is strong necessity for thee, for by what means wilt thou
  escape the marriage?</p>

  <p>ANT. That night then shall find me one of the Danaïdæ.</p>

  <p>CRE. Dost mark with what audacity she hath insulted us?</p>

  <p>ANT. The steel be witness, and the sword, by which I swear.</p>

  <p>CRE. But why art thou so eager to get rid of this marriage?</p>

  <p>ANT. I will take my flight with my most wretched father here.</p>

  <p>CRE. There is nobleness in thee; but there is some degree of
  folly.</p>

  <p>ANT. And I will die with him too, that thou mayest farther know.</p>

  <p>CRE. Go&mdash;thou shalt not slay my son&mdash;quit the land.</p>

<p class="center">&#338;DIPUS, ANTIGONE, CHORUS.</p>

  <p>&#338;D. O daughter, I praise thee indeed for thy zealous
  intentions.</p>

  <p>ANT. But if I were to marry, and thou suffer banishment alone, my
  father?</p>

  <p>&#338;D. Stay and be happy; I will bear with content mine own
  ills.</p>

  <p>ANT. And who will minister to thee, blind as thou art, my father?</p>

  <p>&#338;D. Falling wherever it shall be my fate, I will lie on the
  ground.</p>

  <p>ANT. But &#338;dipus, where is he? and the renowned Enigmas?</p>

  <p>&#338;D. Perished! one day blest me, and one day destroyed.</p>

  <p>ANT. Ought not I then to have a share in thy woes?</p>

  <p>&#338;D. To a daughter exile with a blind father is shameful.</p>

  <p>ANT. Not to a right-minded one however, but honorable, my father.</p>

  <p>&#338;D. Lead me now onward, that I may touch thy mother.</p>

  <p>ANT. There: touch the aged woman with thy most dear hand.</p>

  <p>&#338;D. O mother! Oh most hapless wife!</p>

  <p>ANT. She doth lie miserable, having all ills at once on her.</p>

  <p>&#338;D. But where is the fallen body of Eteocles, and of
  Polynices?</p>

  <p>ANT. They lie extended before thee near one another.</p>

  <p>&#338;D. Place my blind hand upon their unhappy faces.</p>

  <p>ANT. There: touch thy dead children with thy hand.</p>

  <p>&#338;D. O ye dear wrecks, unhappy, of an unhappy father.</p>

  <p>ANT. O name of Polynices, most dear indeed to me.</p>

  <p>&#338;D. Now, my child, is the oracle of Apollo come to pass.</p>

  <p>ANT. What? but dost thou mention evils in addition to these evils?</p>

  <p>&#338;D. That I must die an exile at Athens.</p>

  <p>ANT. Where? what citadel of Attica will receive thee?</p>

  <p>&#338;D. The sacred Colonus, and the temple of the Equestrian God. But
  stay&mdash;minister to thy blind father here, since thou art desirous of
  sharing his exile.</p>

  <p>ANT. Go to thy wretched banishment: stretch forth thy dear hand, O
  aged father, having me as thy guide, as the gale that wafts the ship.</p>

  <p>&#338;D. Behold, I go, my child, be thou my unhappy conductor.</p>

  <p>ANT. We are, we are indeed unhappy above all Theban virgins.</p>

  <p>&#338;D. Where shall I place my aged footstep? Bring my staff, my
  child.</p>

  <p>ANT. This way, this way come; here, here place thy foot, thou that
  hast the strength of a dream.</p>

  <p>&#338;D. Alas! alas! for my most wretched flight!&mdash;To drive me,
  old as I am, from my country&mdash;Alas! alas! the dreadful, dreadful
  things that I have suffered!</p>

  <p>ANT. What suffered! what suffered!<a name="Phoen_51"></a><a
  href="#PhoenN_51"><sup>[51]</sup></a> Vengeance sees not the wicked, nor
  repays the foolishness of mortals.</p>

  <p>&#338;D. That man am I, who mounted aloft to the victorious heavenly
  song, having solved the dark enigma of the virgin Sphinx.</p>

  <p>ANT. Dost thou bring up again the glory of the Sphinx? Forbear from
  speaking of thy former successes. These wretched sufferings awaited thee,
  O father, being an exile from thy country to die any where. Leaving with
  my dear virgins tears for my loss, I depart far from my country,
  wandering in state not like a virgin's.</p>

  <p>&#338;D. Oh! the excellency of thy mind!</p>

  <p>ANT. In the calamities of a father at least it will make me glorious.
  Wretched am I, on account of the insults offered to thee and to my
  brother, who has perished from the family, a corse denied sepulture,
  unhappy, whom, even if I must die, my father, I will cover with secret
  earth.</p>

  <p>&#338;D. Go, show thyself to thy companions.</p>

  <p>ANT. They have enough of my lamentations.</p>

  <p>&#338;D. But make thy supplications at the altars.</p>

  <p>ANT. They have a satiety of my woes.</p>

  <p>&#338;D. Go then, where stands the fane of Bacchus unapproached, on
  the mountains of the Mænades.</p>

  <p>ANT. To whom I formerly, clad in the skin of the Theban fawn, danced
  the sacred step of Semele on the mountains, conferring a thankless favor
  on the Gods?</p>

  <p>&#338;D. O ye inhabitants of my illustrious country, behold, I, this
  &#338;dipus, who alone stayed the violence of the bloodthirsty Sphinx,
  now, dishonored, forsaken, miserable, am banished from the land. Yet why
  do I bewail these things, and lament in vain? For the necessity of fate
  proceeding from the Gods a mortal must endure.</p>

<h3>THE ARGUMENT.</h3>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>JASON, having come to Corinth, and bringing with him Medea, espouses
  Glauce, the daughter of Creon, king of Corinth. But Medea, on the point
  of being banished from Corinth by Creon, having asked to remain one day,
  and having obtained her wish, sends to Glauce, by the hands of her sons,
  presents, as an acknowledgment for the favor, a robe and a golden
  chaplet, which she puts on and perishes; Creon also having embraced his
  daughter is destroyed. But Medea, when she had slain her children,
  escapes to Athens, in a chariot drawn by winged dragons, which she
  received from the Sun, and there marries Ægeus son of Pandion.</p>

  <p>Would that the hull of Argo had not winged her way to the Colchian

  of Pelion had never fallen, nor had caused the hands of the chiefs to
  row,<a name="Med_2"></a><a href="#MedN_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> who went in
  search of the golden fleece for Pelias; for neither then would my
  mistress Medea have sailed to the towers of the Iolcian land, deeply
  smitten in her mind with the love of Jason; nor having persuaded the
  daughters of Pelias to slay their father would she have inhabited this
  country of Corinth with her husband and her children, pleasing indeed by
  her flight<a name="Med_3"></a><a href="#MedN_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> the
  citizens to whose land she came, and herself concurring in every respect
  with Jason; which is the surest support of conjugal happiness, when the
  wife is not estranged from the husband. But now every thing is at
  variance, and the dearest ties are weakened. For having betrayed his own
  children, and my mistress, Jason reposes in royal wedlock, having married
  the daughter of Creon, who is prince of this land. But Medea the unhappy,
  dishonored, calls on his oaths, and recalls the hands they plighted, the
  greatest pledge of fidelity, and invokes the gods to witness what return
  she meets with from Jason. And she lies without tasting food, having sunk
  her body in grief, dissolving all her tedious time in tears, after she
  had once known that she had been injured by her husband, neither raising
  her eye, nor lifting her countenance from the ground; but as the rock, or
  the wave of the sea, does she listen to her friends when advised. Save
  that sometimes having turned her snow-white neck she to herself bewails
  her dear father, and her country, and her house, having betrayed which
  she hath come hither with a man who has now dishonored her. And she
  wretched hath discovered from affliction what it is not to forsake one's
  paternal country. But she hates her children, nor is she delighted at
  beholding them: but I fear her, lest she form some new design: for
  violent is her mind, nor will it endure to suffer ills. I know her, and I
  fear her, lest she should force the sharpened sword through her heart, or
  even should murder the princess and him who married her, and after that
  receive some greater ill. For she is violent; he who engages with her in
  enmity will not with ease at least sing the song of victory. But these
  her children are coming hither having ceased from their exercises,
  nothing mindful of their mother's ills, for the mind of youth is not wont
  to grieve.</p>

<p class="center">TUTOR, WITH THE SONS OF MEDEA, NURSE.</p>

  <p>TUT. O thou ancient possession of my mistress's house, why dost thou
  stand at the gates preserving thus thy solitude, bewailing to thyself our
  misfortunes? How doth Medea wish to be left alone without thee?</p>

  <p>NUR. O aged man, attendant on the children of Jason, to faithful
  servants the affairs of their masters turning out ill are a calamity, and
  lay hold upon their feelings. For I have arrived at such a height of
  grief that desire hath stolen on me to come forth hence and tell the
  misfortunes of Medea to the earth and heaven.</p>

  <p>TUT. Does not she wretched yet receive any respite from her grief?</p>

  <p>NUR. I envy thy ignorance; her woe is at its rise, and not even yet at
  its height.</p>

  <p>TUT. O unwise woman, if it is allowable to say this of one's lords,
  since she knows nothing of later ills.</p>

  <p>NUR. But what is this, O aged man? grudge not to tell me.</p>

  <p>TUT. Nothing: I have repented even of what was said before.</p>

  <p>NUR. Do not, I beseech you by your beard, conceal it from your
  fellow-servant; for I will preserve silence, if it be necessary, on these
  subjects.</p>

  <p>TUT. I heard from some one who was saying, not appearing to listen,
  having approached the places where dice is played, where the elders sit,
  around the hallowed font of Pirene, that the king of this land, Creon,
  intends to banish from the Corinthian country these children, together
  with their mother; whether this report be true, however, I know not; but
  I wish this may not be the case.</p>

  <p>NUR. And will Jason endure to see his children suffer this, even
  although he is at enmity with their mother?</p>

  <p>TUT. Ancient alliances are deserted for new, and he is no friend to
  this family.</p>

  <p>NUR. We perish then, if to the old we shall add a new ill, before the
  former be exhausted.<a name="Med_4"></a><a
  href="#MedN_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>

  <p>TUT. But do thou, for it is not seasonable that my mistress should
  know this, restrain your tongue, and be silent on this report.</p>

  <p>NUR. O my children, do you hear what your father is toward you? Yet
  may he not perish, for he is my master, yet he is found to be treacherous
  toward his friends.</p>

  <p>TUT. And what man is not? dost thou only now know this, that every one
  loves himself dearer than his neighbor,<a name="Med_5"></a><a
  href="#MedN_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> some indeed with justice, but others
  even for the sake of gain, unless it be that<a name="Med_6"></a><a
  href="#MedN_6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> their father loves not these at least
  on account of new nuptials.</p>

  <p>NUR. Go within the house, my children, for all will be well. But do
  thou keep these as much as possible out of the way, and let them not
  approach their mother, deranged through grief. For but now I saw her
  looking with wildness in her eyes on these, as about to execute some
  design, nor will she cease from her fury, I well know, before she
  overwhelm some one with it; upon her enemies however, and not her
  friends, may she do some [ill.]</p>

  <p>MEDEA. (<i>within</i>) Wretch that I am, and miserable on account of
  my misfortunes, alas me! would I might perish!</p>

  <p>NUR. Thus it is, my children; your mother excites her heart, excites
  her fury. Hasten as quick as possible within the house, and come not near
  her sight, nor approach her, but guard against the fierce temper and
  violent nature of her self-willed mind. Go now, go as quick as possible
  within. But it is evident that the cloud of grief raised up from the
  beginning will quickly burst forth with greater fury; what I pray will
  her soul, great in rage, implacable, irritated by ills, perform!</p>

  <p>MED. Alas! alas! I wretched have suffered, have suffered treatment
  worthy of great lamentation. O ye accursed children of a hated mother,
  may ye perish with your father, and may the whole house fall.</p>

  <p>NUR. Alas! alas! me miserable! but why should your children share
  their father's error? Why dost thou hate these! Alas me, my children, how
  beyond measure do I grieve lest ye suffer any evil! Dreadful are the
  dispositions of tyrants, and somehow in few things controlled, in most
  absolute, they with difficulty lay aside their passion. The being
  accustomed then<a name="Med_7"></a><a href="#MedN_7"><sup>[7]</sup></a>
  to live in mediocrity of life is the better: may it be my lot then to
  grow old if not in splendor, at least in security. For, in the first
  place, even to mention the name of moderation carries with it
  superiority, but to use it is by far the best conduct for men; but excess
  of fortune brings more power to men than is convenient;<a
  name="Med_8"></a><a href="#MedN_8"><sup>[8]</sup></a> and has brought
  greater woes upon families, when the Deity be enraged.</p>

<p class="center">NURSE, CHORUS.</p>

  <p>CHOR. I heard the voice, I heard the cry of the unhappy Colchian; is
  not she yet appeased? but, O aged matron, tell me; for within the
  apartment with double doors, I heard her cry; nor am I delighted, O
  woman, with the griefs of the family, since it is friendly to me.</p>

  <p>NUR. The family is not; these things are gone already: for he
  possesses the bed of royalty; but she, my mistress, is melting away her
  life in her chamber, in no way soothing her mind by the advice of any one
  of her friends.</p>

  <p>MED. Alas! alas! may the flame of heaven rush through my head, what
  profit for me to live any longer. Alas! alas! may I rest myself in death,
  having left a hated life.</p>

  <p>CHOR. Dost thou hear, O Jove, and earth, and light, the cry which the
  wretched bride utters? why I pray should this insatiable love of the
  marriage-bed hasten thee, O vain woman, to death? Pray not for this. But
  if thy husband courts a new bed, be not thus<a name="Med_9"></a><a
  href="#MedN_9"><sup>[9]</sup></a> enraged with him. Jove will avenge
  these wrongs for thee: waste not thyself so, bewailing thy husband.</p>

  <p>MED. O great Themis and revered Diana, do ye behold what I suffer,
  having bound my accursed husband by powerful oaths? Whom may I at some
  time see and his bride torn piecemeal with their very houses, who dare to
  injure me first. O my father, O my city, whom I basely abandoned, having
  slain my brother.</p>

  <p>NUR. Do ye hear what she says, and how she invokes Themis hearing the
  vow, and Jove who is considered the dispenser of oaths to mortals? It is
  not possible that my mistress will lull her rage to rest on any trivial
  circumstance.</p>

  <p>CHOR. By what means could she come into our sight, and hear the voice
  of our discourse, if she would by any means remit her fierce anger and
  her fury of mind. Let not my zeal however be wanting ever to my friends.
  But go and conduct her hither from without the house, my friend, and tell
  her this, hasten, before she injure in any way those within, for this
  grief of hers is increased to a great height.</p>

  <p>NUR. I will do it, but I fear that I shall not persuade my mistress;
  nevertheless I will give you this favor of my labor. And yet with the
  aspect of a lioness that has just brought forth does she look sternly on
  her attendants when any one approaches near attempting to address her.
  But thou wouldest not err in calling men of old foolish and nothing wise,
  who invented songs, for festivals, for banquets, and for suppers, the
  delights of life that charm the ear; but no mortal has discovered how to
  soothe with music and with varied strains those bitter pangs, from which
  death and dreadful misfortunes overthrow families. And yet for men to
  assuage these griefs with music were gain; but where the plenteous
  banquet is furnished, why raise they the song in vain? for the present
  bounty of the feast brings pleasure of itself to men.</p>

  <p>CHOR. I heard the dismal sound of groans, and in a shrill voice she
  vents her bitter<a name="Med_10"></a><a
  href="#MedN_10"><sup>[10]</sup></a> anguish on the traitor to her bed,
  her faithless husband&mdash;and suffering wrongs she calls upon the
  Goddess Themis, arbitress of oaths, daughter of Jove, who conducted her
  to the opposite coast of Greece, across the sea by night, over the salt
  straits of the boundless ocean.</p>

<p class="center">MEDEA, CHORUS.</p>

  <p>MED. Ye Corinthian dames, I have come from out my palace; do not in
  any wise blame me; for I have known many men who have been<a
  name="Med_11"></a><a href="#MedN_11"><sup>[11]</sup></a> renowned, some
  who have lived far from public notice, and others in the world; but those
  of a retired turn have gained for themselves a character of infamy and
  indolence. For justice dwells not in the eyes of man,<a
  name="Med_12"></a><a href="#MedN_12"><sup>[12]</sup></a> whoever, before
  he can well discover the disposition of a man, hates him at sight, in no
  way wronged by him. But it is necessary for a stranger exactly to conform
  himself to the state, nor would I praise the native, whoever becoming
  self-willed is insolent to his fellow-citizens through ignorance. But
  this unexpected event that hath fallen upon me hath destroyed my spirit:
  I am going, and having given up the pleasure of life I am desirous to
  meet death, my friends. For he on whom my all rested, as you well know,
  my husband, has turned out the basest of men. But of all things as many
  as have life and intellect, we women are the most wretched race. Who
  indeed first must purchase a husband with excess of money, and receive
  him a lord of our persons; for this is a still greater ill than the
  former. And in this is the greatest risk, whether we receive a bad one or
  a good one; for divorces bring not good fame to women, nor is it possible
  to repudiate one's husband. But on passing to new tempers and new laws,
  one need be a prophetess, as one can not learn of one's self, what sort
  of consort one shall most likely experience. And if with us carefully
  performing these things a husband shall dwell not imposing on us a yoke
  with severity, enviable is our life; if not, to die is better. But a man,
  when he is displeased living with those at home, having gone abroad is
  wont to relieve his heart of uneasiness, having recourse either to some
  friend or compeer. But we must look but to one person. But they say of us
  that we live a life of ease at home, but they are fighting with the
  spear; judging ill, since I would rather thrice stand in arms, than once
  suffer the pangs of child-birth. But, for the same argument comes not
  home to you and me, this is thy city, and thy father's house, thine are
  both the luxuries of life, and the society of friends; but I being
  destitute, cityless, am wronged by my husband, brought as a prize from a
  foreign land, having neither mother, nor brother, nor relation to afford
  me shelter from this calamity. So much then I wish to obtain from you, if
  any plan or contrivance be devised by me to repay with justice these
  injuries on my husband, and on him who gave his daughter, and on her to
  whom he was married,<a name="Med_13"></a><a
  href="#MedN_13"><sup>[13]</sup></a> that you would be silent; for a woman
  in other respects is full of fear, and timid to look upon deeds of
  courage and the sword; but when she is injured in her bed, no other
  disposition is more blood-thirsty.</p>

  <p>CHOR. I will do this; for with justice, Medea, wilt thou avenge
  thyself on thy husband, and I do not wonder that you lament your
  misfortunes. But I see Creon monarch of this land advancing, the
  messenger of new counsels.</p>

<p class="center">CREON, MEDEA, CHORUS.</p>

  <p>CRE. Thee of gloomy countenance, and enraged with thy husband, Medea,
  I command to depart in exile from out of this land, taking with thee thy
  two children, and not to delay in any way, since I am the arbiter of this
  edict, and I will not return back to my palace, until I shall drive thee
  beyond the boundaries of this realm.</p>

  <p>MED. Alas! alas! I wretched am utterly destroyed, for my enemies
  stretch out every cable against me; nor is there any easy escape from
  this evil, but I will speak, although suffering injurious treatment; for
  what, Creon, dost thou drive me from this land?</p>

  <p>CRE. I fear thee (there is no need for me to wrap my words in
  obscurity,) lest thou do my child some irremediable mischief, And many
  circumstances are in unison with this dread. Thou art wise, and skilled
  in many evil sciences, and thou art exasperated, deprived of thy
  husband's bed. And I hear that thou threatenest, as they tell me, to
  wreak some deed of vengeance on the betrother, and the espouser and the
  espoused; against this then, before I suffer, will I guard. Better is it
  for me now to incur enmity from you, than softened by your words
  afterward greatly to lament it.</p>

  <p>MED. Alas! alas! not now for the first time, but often, Creon, hath
  this opinion injured me, and worked me much woe. But whatever man is
  prudent, let him never educate his children too deep in wisdom. For,
  independent of the other charges of idleness which they meet with, they
  find hostile envy from their fellow-citizens. For holding out to fools
  some new-discovered wisdom, thou wilt seem to be useless and not wise.
  And being judged superior to others who seem to have some varied
  knowledge, thou wilt appear offensive in the city. But even I myself
  share this fortune; for being wise, to some I am an object of envy, but
  to others, unsuited; but I am not very wise. Thou then fearest me, lest
  thou suffer some grievous mischief.<a name="Med_14"></a><a
  href="#MedN_14"><sup>[14]</sup></a> My affairs are not in a state, fear
  me not, Creon, so as to offend against princes. For in what hast thou
  injured me? Thou hast given thy daughter to whom thy mind led thee; but I
  hate my husband: but thou, I think, didst these things in prudence. And
  now I envy not that thy affairs are prospering; make your alliances, be
  successful; but suffer me to dwell in this land, for although injured
  will I keep silence, overcome by my superiors.</p>

  <p>CRE. Thou speakest soft words to the ear, but within my mind I have my
  fears, lest thou meditate some evil intent. And so much the less do I
  trust thee than before. For a woman that is quick to anger, and a man
  likewise, is easier to guard against, than one that is crafty and keeps
  silence. But begone as quick as possible, make no more words; since this
  is decreed, and thou hast no art, by which thou wilt stay with us, being
  hostile to me.</p>

  <p>MED. No I beseech you by your knees, and your newly-married
  daughter.</p>

  <p>CRE. Thou wastest words; for thou wilt never persuade me.</p>

  <p>MED. Wilt thou then banish me, nor reverence my prayers?</p>

  <p>CRE. For I do not love thee better than my own family.</p>

  <p>MED. O my country, how I remember thee now!</p>

  <p>CRE. For next to my children it is much the dearest thing to me.</p>

  <p>MED. Alas! alas! how great an ill is love to man!</p>

  <p>CRE. That is, I think, as fortune also shall attend it.</p>

  <p>MED. Jove, let it not escape thine eye, who is the cause of these
  misfortunes.</p>

  <p>CRE. Begone, fond woman, and free me from these cares.</p>

  <p>MED. Care indeed;<a name="Med_15"></a><a
  href="#MedN_15"><sup>[15]</sup></a> and do not I experience cares?</p>

  <p>CRE. Quickly shalt thou be driven hence by force by the hands of my
  domestics.</p>

  <p>MED. No, I pray not this at least; but I implore thee, Creon.</p>

  <p>CRE. Thou wilt give trouble, woman, it seems.<a name="Med_16"></a><a
  href="#MedN_16"><sup>[16]</sup></a></p>

  <p>MED. I will go; I dare not ask to obtain this of you.</p>

  <p>CRE. Why then dost thou resist, and wilt not depart from these
  realms?</p>

  <p>MED. Permit me to remain here this one day, and to bring my purpose to
  a conclusion, in what way we shall fly, and to make provision for my
  sons, since their father in no way regards providing for his children;
  but pity them, for thou also art the father of children; and it is
  probable that thou hast tenderness: for of myself I have no care whether
  I may suffer banishment, but I weep for them experiencing this
  calamity.</p>

  <p>CRE. My disposition is least of all imperious, and through feeling
  pity in many cases have I injured myself. And now I see that I am doing
  wrong, O lady, but nevertheless thou shalt obtain thy request; but this I
  warn thee, if to-morrow's light of the God of day shall behold thee and
  thy children within the confines of these realms, thou shalt die: this
  word is spoken in truth. But now if thou must stay, remain here yet one
  day, for thou wilt not do any horrid deed of which I have dread.</p>

<p class="center">MEDEA, CHORUS.</p>

  <p>CHOR. Unhappy woman! alas wretched on account of thy griefs! whither
  wilt thou turn? what hospitality, or house, or country wilt thou find a
  refuge for these ills? how the Deity hath led thee, Medea, into a
  pathless tide of woes!</p>

  <p>MED. Ill hath it been done on every side. Who will gainsay it? but
  these things are not in this way, do not yet think it. Still is there a
  contest for those lately married, and to those allied to them no small
  affliction. For dost thou think I ever would have fawned upon this man,
  if I were not to gain something, or form some plan? I would not even have
  addressed him. I would not even have touched him with my hands. But he
  hath arrived at such a height of folly, as that, when it was in his power
  to have crushed my plans, by banishing me from this land, he hath granted
  me to stay this day in which three of mine enemies will I put to death,
  the father, the bride, and my husband. But having in my power many
  resources of destruction against them, I know not, my friends, which I
  shall first attempt. Whether shall I consume the bridal house with fire,
  or force the sharpened sword through her heart having entered the chamber
  by stealth where the couch is spread? But one thing is against me; if I
  should be caught entering the house and prosecuting my plans, by my death
  I shall afford laughter for my foes. Best then is it to pursue the
  straight path, in which I am most skilled, to take them off by poison.
  Let it be so. And suppose them dead: what city will receive me? What
  hospitable stranger affording a land of safety and a faithful home will
  protect my person? There is none. Waiting then yet a little time, if any
  tower of safety shall appear to us, I will proceed to this murder in
  treachery and silence. But if ill fortune that leaves me without resource
  force me, I myself having grasped the sword, although I should die, will
  kill them, and will rush to the extreme height of daring. For never, I
  swear by my mistress whom I revere most of all, and have chosen for my
  assistant, Hecate, who dwells in the inmost recesses of my house, shall
  any one of them wring my heart with grief with impunity. Bitter and
  mournful to them will I make these nuptials, and bitter this alliance,
  and my flight from this land. But come, spare none of these sciences in
  which thou art skilled, Medea, deliberating and plotting. Proceed to the
  deed of terror: now is the time of resolution: seest thou what thou art
  suffering? Ill doth it become thee to incur ridicule from the race of
  Sisyphus, and from the nuptials of Jason, who art sprung from a noble
  father, and from the sun. And thou art skilled. Besides also we women
  are, by nature, to good actions of the least capacity, but the most
  cunning inventors of every ill.</p>

  <p>CHOR. The waters of the hallowed streams flow upward to their sources,
  and justice and every thing is reversed. The counsels of men are
  treacherous, and no longer is the faith of heaven firm. But fame changes,
  so that my sex may have the glory.<a name="Med_17"></a><a
  href="#MedN_17"><sup>[17]</sup></a> Honor cometh to the female race; no
  longer shall opprobrious fame oppress the women. But the Muses shall
  cease from their ancient strains, from celebrating our perfidy. For
  Ph&#339;bus, leader of the choir, gave not to our minds the heavenly
  music of the lyre, since they would in turn have raised a strain against
  the race of men. But time of old hath much to say both of our life and
  the life of men. But thou hast sailed from thy father's house with
  maddened heart, having passed through the double rocks of the ocean, and
  thou dwellest in a foreign land, having lost the shelter of thy widowed
  bed, wretched woman, and art driven dishonored an exile from this land.
  The reverence of oaths is gone, nor does shame any longer dwell in mighty
  Greece, but hath fled away through the air. But thou helpless woman hast
  neither father's house to afford you haven from your woes, and another
  more powerful queen of the nuptial bed rules over the house.</p>

<p class="center">JASON, MEDEA, CHORUS.</p>

  <p>JAS. Not now for the first time, but often have I perceived that
  fierce anger is an irremediable ill. For though it was in your power to
  inhabit this land and this house, bearing with gentleness the
  determination of thy superiors, by thy rash words thou shalt be banished
  from this land. And to me indeed it is of no importance; never cease from
  saying that Jason is the worst of men. But for what has been said by thee
  against the royal family, think it the greatest good fortune that thou
  art punished by banishment only. I indeed was always employed in
  diminishing the anger of the enraged princes, and was willing that thou
  shouldest remain. But thou remittest not of thy folly, always reviling
  the ruling powers; wherefore thou shalt be banished from the land. But
  nevertheless even after this am I come, not wearied with my friends,
  providing for thee, O woman, that thou mightest not be banished with thy
  children, either without money, or in want of any thing. Banishment draws
  many misfortunes with it. For although thou hatest me, I never could wish
  thee evil.</p>

  <p>MED. O thou vilest of men (for this is the greatest reproach I have in
  my power with my tongue to tell thee, for thy unmanly cowardice), hast
  thou come to us, hast thou come, who art most hateful? This is not
  fortitude, or confidence, to look in the face of friends whom thou hast
  injured, but the worst of all diseases among men, impudence. But thou
  hast done well in coming. For both I shall be lightened in my heart while
  reviling thee, and thou wilt be pained at hearing me. But I will first
  begin to speak from the first circumstances. I preserved thee (as those
  Greeks well know as many as embarked with thee on board the same ship
  Argo) when sent to master the fire-breathing bulls with the yoke, and to
  sow the fatal seed: and having slain the dragon who watching around the
  golden fleece guarded it with spiry folds, a sleepless guard, I raised up
  to thee a light of safety. But I myself having betrayed my father, and my
  house, came to the Peliotic Iolcos<a name="Med_18"></a><a
  href="#MedN_18"><sup>[18]</sup></a> with thee, with more readiness than
  prudence. And I slew Pelias by a death which it is most miserable to die,
  by the hands of his own children, and I freed thee from every fear. And
  having experienced these services from me, thou vilest of men, thou hast
  betrayed me and hast procured for thyself a new bed, children being born
  to thee, for if thou wert still childless it would be pardonable in thee
  to be enamored of this alliance. But the faith of oaths is vanished: nor
  can I discover whether thou thinkest that the former Gods are not still
  in power, or whether new laws are now laid down for men, since thou art
  at least conscious of being perjured toward me. Alas! this right hand
  which thou hast often touched, and these knees, since in vain have I been
  polluted by a wicked husband, and have failed in my hopes. Come (for I
  will converse with thee as with a friend, not expecting to receive any
  benefit from thee at least, but nevertheless I will; for when questioned
  thou wilt appear more base), now whither shall I turn? Whether to my
  father's house, which I betrayed for thee, and my country, and came
  hither? or to the miserable daughters of Pelias? friendly would they
  indeed receive me in their house, whose father I slew. For thus it is: I
  am in enmity with my friends at home; but those whom I ought not to
  injure, by obliging thee, I make my enemies. On which account in return
  for this thou hast made me to be called happy by many dames through
  Greece, and in thee I, wretch that I am, have an admirable and faithful
  husband, if cast out at least I shall fly this land, deserted by my
  friends, lonely with thy lonely children. Fair renown indeed to the new
  married bridegroom, that his children are wandering in poverty, and I
  also who preserved thee. O Jove, why I pray hast thou given to men
  certain proofs of the gold which is adulterate, but no mark is set by
  nature on the person of men by which one may distinguish the bad man.</p>

  <p>CHOR. Dreadful is that anger and irremediable, when friends with
  friends kindle strife.</p>

  <p>JAS. It befits me, it seems, not to be weak in argument, but as the
  prudent pilot of a vessel, with all the sail that can be hoisted, to run
  from out of thy violent abuse, O woman. But I, since thou thus much
  vauntest thy favors, think that Venus alone both of Gods and men was the
  protectress of my voyage. But thou hast a fickle mind, but it is an
  invidious account to go through, how love compelled thee with his
  inevitable arrows to preserve my life. But I will not follow up arguments
  with too great accuracy, for where thou hast assisted me it is well.
  Moreover thou hast received more at least from my safety than thou
  gavest, as I will explain to thee. First of all thou dwellest in Greece
  instead of a foreign land, and thou learnest what justice is, and to
  enjoy laws, not to be directed by mere force. And all the Grecians have
  seen that thou art wise, and thou hast renown; but if thou wert dwelling
  in the extreme confines of that land, there would not have been fame of
  thee. But may neither gold in my house be be my lot, nor to attune the
  strain more sweet than Orpheus, if my fortune be not conspicuous. So much
  then have I said of my toils; for thou first broughtest forward this
  contest of words. But with regard to those reproaches which thou heapest
  on me for my royal marriage, in this will I show first that I have been
  wise, in the next place moderate, thirdly a great friend to thee, and my
  children: but be silent. After I had come hither from the Iolcian land
  bringing with me many grievous calamities, what measure more fortunate
  than this could I have invented, than, an exile as I was, to marry the
  daughter of the monarch? not, by which thou art grated, loathing thy bed,
  nor smitten with desire of a new bride, nor having emulation of a
  numerous offspring, for those born to me are sufficient, nor do I find
  fault with that; but that (which is of the greatest consequence) we might
  live honorably, and might not be in want, knowing well that every friend
  flies out of the way of a poor man; and that I might bring up my children
  worthy of my house, and that having begotten brothers to those children
  sprung from thee, I might place them on the same footing, and having
  united the family, I might flourish; for both thou hast some need of
  children, and to me it were advantageous to advance my present progeny by
  means of the children which might arise; have I determined ill? not even
  thou couldest say so, if thy bed did not gall thee. But thus far have you
  come, that your bed being safe, you women think that you have every
  thing. But if any misfortune befall that, the most excellent and fairest
  objects you make the most hateful. It were well then that men should
  generate children from some other source, and that the female race should
  not exist, and thus there would not have been any evil among men.<a
  name="Med_19"></a><a href="#MedN_19"><sup>[19]</sup></a></p>

  <p>CHOR. Jason, thou hast well adorned these arguments of thine, but
  nevertheless to me, although I speak reluctantly, thou appearest, in
  betraying thy wife, to act unjustly.</p>

  <p>MED. Surely I am in many things different from many mortals, for in my
  judgment, whatever man being unjust, is deeply skilled in argument,
  merits the severest punishment. For vaunting that with his tongue he can
  well gloze over injustice, he dares to work deceit, but he is not
  over-wise. Thus do not thou also be now plausible to me, nor skilled in
  speaking, for one word will overthrow thee: it behooved thee, if thou
  wert not a bad man, to have contracted this marriage having persuaded me,
  and not without the knowledge of thy friends.</p>

  <p>JAS. Well wouldest thou have lent assistance to this report, if I had
  mentioned the marriage to thee, who not even now endurest to lay aside
  this unabated rage of heart.</p>

  <p>MED. This did not move thee, but a foreign bed would lead in its
  result to an old age without honor.</p>

  <p>JAS. Be well assured of this, that I did not form this alliance with
  the princess, which I now hold, for the sake of the woman, but, as I said
  before also, wishing to preserve thee, and to beget royal children
  brothers to my sons, a support to our house.</p>

  <p>MED. Let not a splendid life of bitterness be my lot, nor wealth,
  which rends my heart.</p>

  <p>JAS. Dost thou know how to alter thy prayers, and appear wiser? Let
  not good things ever seem to you bitter, nor when in prosperity seem to
  be in adversity.</p>

  <p>MED. Insult me, since thou hast refuge, but I destitute shall fly this
  land.</p>

  <p>JAS. Thou chosest this thyself, blame no one else.</p>

  <p>MED. By doing what? by marrying and betraying thee?</p>

  <p>JAS. By imprecating unhallowed curses on the royal family.</p>

  <p>MED. From thy house at least am I laden with curses.</p>

  <p>JAS. I will not dispute more of this with thee. But if thou wishest to
  receive either for thyself or children any part of my wealth as an
  assistant on thy flight, speak, since I am ready to give with an
  unsparing hand, and to send tokens of hospitality to my friends, who will
  treat you well; and refusing these thou wilt be foolish, woman, but
  ceasing from thine anger, thou wilt gain better treatment.</p>

  <p>MED. I will neither use thy friends, nor will I receive aught; do not
  give to me, for the gifts of a bad man bring no assistance.</p>

  <p>JAS. Then I call the Gods to witness, that I wish to assist thee and
  thy children in every thing; but good things please thee not, but thou
  rejectest thy friends with audacity, wherefore shalt thou grieve the
  more.</p>

  <p>MED. Begone, for thou art captured by desire of thy new bride,
  tarrying so long without the palace; wed her, for perhaps, but with the
  assistance of the God shall it be said, thou wilt make such a marriage
  alliance, as thou wilt hereafter wish to renounce.</p>

  <p>CHOR. The loves, when they come too impetuously, have given neither
  good report nor virtue among men, but if Venus come with moderation, no
  other Goddess is so benign. Never, O my mistress, mayest thou send forth
  against me from thy golden bow thy inevitable shaft, having steeped it in
  desire. But may temperance preserve me, the noblest gift of heaven; never
  may dreaded Venus, having smitten my mind for another's bed, heap upon me
  jealous passions and unabated quarrels, but approving the peaceful union,
  may she quick of perception sit in judgment on the bed of women. O my
  country, and my house, never may I be an outcast of my city, having a
  life scarce to be endured through poverty, the most lamentable of all
  woes. By death, by death, may I before that be subdued, having lived to
  accomplish that day; but no greater misfortune is there than to be
  deprived of one's paternal country. We have seen it, nor have we to speak
  from others' accounts; for thee, neither city nor friend hath pitied,
  though suffering the most dreadful anguish. Thankless may he perish who
  desires not to assist his friends, having unlocked the pure treasures of
  his mind; never shall he be friend to me.</p>

<p class="center">ÆGEUS, MEDEA, CHORUS.</p>

ÆG. Medea, hail! for no one hath known a more honorable
salutation to address to friends than this.

  <p>MED. Hail thou also, son of the wise Pandion, Ægeus, coming from what
  quarter dost thou tread the plain of this land?</p>

ÆG. Having left the ancient oracle of Ph&#339;bus.

  <p>MED. But wherefore wert thou sent to the prophetic centre of the
  earth?</p>

ÆG. Inquiring of the God how offspring may arise to me?

  <p>MED. By the Gods, tell me, dost thou live this life hitherto
  childless?</p>

ÆG. Childless I am, by the disposal of some deity.

  <p>MED. Hast thou a wife, or knowest thou not the marriage-bed!</p>

ÆG. I am not destitute of the connubial bed.

  <p>MED. What then did Apollo tell thee respecting thy offspring?</p>

ÆG. Words deeper than a man can form opinion of.

  <p>MED. Is it allowable for me to know the oracle of the God?</p>

ÆG. Certainly, inasmuch as it needs also a deep-skilled mind.

  <p>MED. What then did he say? Speak, if I may hear.</p>

ÆG. Before I revisit my paternal hearth.

  <p>MED. Then as desiring what dost thou direct thy voyage to this
  land?</p>

ÆG. There is one Pittheus, king of the country of Trazene.

  <p>MED. The most pious son, as report says, of Pelops.</p>

ÆG. To him I wish to communicate the oracle of the God.

  <p>MED. For he is a wise man, and versed in such matters.</p>

ÆG. And to me at least the dearest of all my friends in war.

  <p>MED. Mayest thou prosper, and obtain what thou desirest.</p>

ÆG. But why is thine eye and thy color thus faded?

  <p>MED. Ægeus, my husband is the worst of all men.</p>

ÆG. What sayest thou? tell me all thy troubles.

  <p>MED. Jason wrongs me, having never suffered wrong from me.</p>

ÆG. Having done what? tell me more clearly.

  <p>MED. He hath here a wife besides me, mistress of the house.</p>

ÆG. Hath he dared to commit this disgraceful action?

  <p>MED. Be assured he has; but we his former friends are dishonored.</p>

ÆG. Enamored of her, or hating thy bed?

  <p>MED. [Smitten with] violent love indeed, he was faithless to his
  friends.</p>

ÆG. Let him perish then, since, as you say, he is a bad
man.

  <p>MED. He was charmed to receive an alliance with princes.</p>

ÆG. And who gives the bride to him? finish the account,
I beg.

  <p>MED. Creon, who is monarch of this Corinthian land.</p>

ÆG. Pardonable was it then that thou art grieved, O lady.

  <p>MED. I perish, and in addition to this am I banished from this
  land.</p>

ÆG. By whom? thou art mentioning another fresh misfortune.

  <p>MED. Creon drives me an exile out of this land of Corinth.</p>

ÆG. And does Jason suffer it? I praise not this.

  <p>MED. By his words he does not, but at heart he wishes [to endure my
  banishment:] but by this thy beard I entreat thee, and by these thy
  knees, and I become thy suppliant, pity me, pity this unfortunate woman,
  nor behold me going forth in exile abandoned, but receive me at thy
  hearth in thy country and thy house. Thus by the Gods shall thy desire of
  children be accomplished to thee, and thou thyself shalt die in
  happiness. But thou knowest not what this fortune is that thou hast
  found; but I will free thee from being childless, and I will cause thee
  to raise up offspring, such charms I know.</p>

ÆG. On many accounts, O lady, am I willing to confer this
favor on thee, first on account of the Gods, then of the
children, whose birth thou holdest forth; for on this point else
I am totally sunk in despair. But thus am I determined: if
thou comest to my country, I will endeavor to receive thee
with hospitality, being a just man; so much however I beforehand
apprise thee of, O lady, I shall not be willing to lead
thee with me from this land; but if thou comest thyself to my
house, thou shalt stay there in safety, and to no one will I
give thee up. But do thou of thyself withdraw thy foot from
this country, for I wish to be without blame even among
strangers.

  <p>MED. It shall be so, but if there was a pledge of this given to me, I
  should have all things from thee in a noble manner.</p>

ÆG. Dost thou not trust me? what is thy difficulty?

  <p>MED. I trust thee; but the house of Pelias is mine enemy, and Creon
  too; to these then, wert thou bound by oaths, thou wouldest not give me
  up from the country, should they attempt to drag me thence. But having
  agreed by words alone, and without calling the Gods to witness, thou
  mightest be their friend, and perhaps<a name="Med_20"></a><a
  href="#MedN_20"><sup>[20]</sup></a> be persuaded by an embassy; for weak
  is my state, but theirs are riches, and a royal house.</p>

ÆG. Thou hast spoken much prudence, O lady. But if it
seems fit to thee that I should do this, I refuse not. For to
me also this seems the safest plan, that I should have some
pretext to show to your enemies, and thy safety is better secured;
propose the Gods that I am to invoke.

  <p>MED. Swear by the earth, and by the sun the father of my father, and
  join the whole race of Gods.</p>

ÆG. That I will do what thing, or what not do? speak.

  <p>MED. That thou wilt neither thyself ever cast me forth from out of thy
  country, nor, if any one of my enemies desire to drag me thence, that
  thou wilt, while living, give me up willingly.</p>

ÆG. I swear by the earth, and the hallowed majesty of
the sun, and by all the Gods, to abide by what I hear from
thee.

  <p>MED. It is sufficient: but what wilt thou endure shouldest thou not
  abide by this oath?</p>

ÆG. That which befalls impious men.

  <p>MED. Go with blessings; for every thing is well. And I will come as
  quick as possible to thy city, having performed what I intend, and having
  obtained what I desire.</p>

  <p>CHOR. But may the son of Maia the king, the guide, conduct thee safely
  to thy house, and the plans of those things, which thou anxiously keepest
  in thy mind, mayest thou bring to completion, since, Ægeus, thou hast
  appeared to us to be a noble man.</p>

<p class="center">MEDEA, CHORUS.</p>

  <p>MED. O Jove, and thou vengeance of Jove, and thou light of the sun,
  now, my friends, shall I obtain a splendid victory over my enemies, and I
  have struck into the path. Now is there hope that my enemies will suffer
  punishment. For this man, where I was most at a loss, hath appeared a
  harbor to my plans. From him will I make fast my cable from the stern,
  having come to the town and citadel of Pallas. But now will I communicate
  all my plans to thee; but receive my words not as attuned to pleasure.
  Having sent one of my domestics, I will ask Jason to come into my
  presence; and when he is come, I will address gentle words to him, as
  that it appears to me that these his actions are both honorable, and are
  advantageous and well determined on.<a name="Med_21"></a><a
  href="#MedN_21"><sup>[21]</sup></a> And I will entreat him that my sons
  may stay; not that I would leave my children in a hostile country for my
  enemies to insult, but that by deceit I may slay the king's daughter. For
  I will send them bearing presents in their hands, both a fine-wrought
  robe, and a golden-twined wreath.<a name="Med_22"></a><a
  href="#MedN_22"><sup>[22]</sup></a> And if she take the ornaments and
  place them round her person, she shall perish miserably, and every one
  who shall touch the damsel; with such charms will I anoint the presents.
  Here however I finish this account; but I bewail the deed such as must
  next be done by me; for I shall slay my children; there is no one who
  shall rescue them from me; and having heaped in ruins the whole house of
  Jason, I will go from out this land, flying the murder of my dearest
  children, and having dared a deed most unhallowed. For it is not to be
  borne, my friends, to be derided by one's enemies. Let things take their
  course; what gain is it to me to live longer? I have neither country, nor
  house, nor refuge from my ills. Then erred I, when I left my father's
  house, persuaded by the words of a Grecian man, who with the will of the
  Gods shall suffer punishment from me. For neither shall he ever hereafter
  behold the children he had by me alive, nor shall he raise a child by his
  new wedded wife, since it is fated that the wretch should wretchedly
  perish by my spells. Let no one think me mean-spirited and weak, nor of a
  gentle temper, but of a contrary disposition to my foes relentless, and
  to my friends kind: for the lives of such sort are most glorious.</p>

  <p>CHOR. Since thou hast communicated this plan to me, desirous both of
  doing good to thee, and assisting the laws of mortals, I dissuade thee
  from doing this.</p>

  <p>MED. It can not be otherwise, but it is pardonable in thee to say
  this, not suffering the cruel treatment that I do.</p>

  <p>CHOR. But wilt thou dare to slay thy two sons, O lady?</p>

  <p>MED. For in this way will my husband be most afflicted.</p>

  <p>CHOR. But thou at least wilt be the most wretched woman.</p>

  <p>MED. Be that as it may: all intervening words are superfluous; but go,
  hasten, and bring Jason hither; for I make use of thee in all matters of
  trust. And thou wilt mention nothing of the plans determined on by me, if
  at least thou meanest well to thy mistress, and art a woman.</p>

  <p>CHOR. The Athenians happy of old, and the descendants of the blessed
  Gods, feeding on the most exalted wisdom of a country sacred and
  unconquered, always tripping elegantly through the purest atmosphere,
  where they say that of old the golden-haired Harmonia gave birth to the
  chaste nine Pierian Muses.<a name="Med_23"></a><a
  href="#MedN_23"><sup>[23]</sup></a> And they report also that Venus
  drawing in her breath from the stream of the fair-flowing Cephisus,
  breathed over their country gentle sweetly-breathing gales of air; and
  always entwining in her hair the fragrant wreath of roses, sends the
  loves as assessors to wisdom; the assistants of every virtue. How then
  will the city of hallowed rivers,<a name="Med_24"></a><a
  href="#MedN_24"><sup>[24]</sup></a> or the country which conducts thee to
  friends, receive the murderer of her children, the unholy one? Consider
  in conjunction with others of the slaughter of thy children, consider
  what a murder thou wilt undertake. Do not by thy knees, by every plea,<a
  name="Med_25"></a><a href="#MedN_25"><sup>[25]</sup></a> by every prayer,
  we entreat you, do not murder your children; but how wilt thou acquire
  confidence either of mind or hand or in heart against thy children,
  attempting a dreadful deed of boldness? But how, having darted thine eyes
  upon thy children, wilt thou endure the perpetration of the murder
  without tears? Thou wilt not<a name="Med_26"></a><a
  href="#MedN_26"><sup>[26]</sup></a> be able, when thy children fall
  suppliant at thy feet, to imbrue thy savage hand in their wretched
  life-blood.</p>

<p class="center">JASON, MEDEA, CHORUS.</p>

  <p>JAS. I am come, by thee requested; for although thou art enraged, thou
  shalt not be deprived of this at least; but I will hear what new service
  thou dost desire of me, lady.</p>

  <p>MED. Jason, I entreat you to be forgiving of what has been said, but
  right is it that you should bear with my anger, since many friendly acts
  have been done by us two. But I reasoned with myself and rebuked myself;
  wayward woman, why am I maddened and am enraged with those who consult
  well for me? and why am I in enmity with the princes of the land and with
  my husband, who is acting in the most advantageous manner for us, having
  married a princess, and begetting brothers to my children? Shall I not
  cease from my rage? What injury do I suffer, the Gods providing well for
  me? Have I not children? And I know that I am flying the country, and am
  in want of friends. Revolving this in my mind I perceive that I had much
  imprudence, and was enraged without reason. Now then I approve of this,
  and thou appearest to me to be prudent, having added this alliance to us;
  but I was foolish, who ought to share in these plans, and to join in
  adorning and to stand by the bed, and to delight with thee that thy bride
  was enamored of thee; but we women are as we are, I will not speak evil
  of the sex; wherefore it is not right that you should put yourself on an
  equality with the evil, nor repay folly for folly. I give up, and say
  that then I erred in judgment, but now I have determined on these things
  better. O my children, my children, come forth, leave the house, come
  forth, salute, and address your father with me, and be reconciled to your
  friends from your former hatred together with your mother. For there is
  amity between us, and my rage hath ceased. Take his right hand. Alas! my
  misfortunes; how I feel some hidden ill in my mind! Will ye, my children,
  in this manner, and for a long time enjoying life, stretch out your dear
  hands? Wretch that I am! how near am I to weeping and full of
  fear!&mdash;But at last canceling this dispute with your father, I have
  filled thus my tender sight with tears.</p>

  <p>CHOR. In my eyes also the moist tear is arisen; and may not the evil
  advance to a greater height than it is at present.</p>

  <p>JAS. I approve of this, lady, nor do I blame the past; for it is
  reasonable that the female sex be enraged with a husband who barters them
  for another union.&mdash;But thy heart has changed to the more proper
  side, and thou hast discovered, but after some time, the better counsel:
  these are the actions of a wise woman. But for you, my sons, your father
  not without thought hath formed many provident plans, with the assistance
  of the Gods. For I think that you will be yet the first in this
  Corinthian country, together with your brothers. But advance and prosper:
  and the rest your father, and whatever God is propitious, will effect.
  And may I behold you blooming arrive at the prime of youth, superior to
  my enemies. And thou, why dost thou bedew thine eyes with the moist tear,
  having turned aside thy white cheek, and why dost thou not receive these
  words from me with pleasure?</p>

  <p>MED. It is nothing. I was thinking of my sons.</p>

  <p>JAS. Be of good courage; for I will arange well for them.</p>

  <p>MED. I will be so, I will not mistrust thy words; but a woman is of
  soft mould, and was born to tears.</p>

  <p>JAS. Why, I pray, dost thou so grieve for thy children?</p>

  <p>MED. I brought them into the world, and when thou wert praying that
  thy children might live, a feeling of pity came upon me if that would be.
  But for what cause thou hast come to a conference with me, partly hath
  been explained, but the other reasons I will mention. Since it appeareth
  fit to the royal family to send me from this country, for me also this
  appears best, I know it well, that I might not dwell here, a check either
  to thee or to the princes of the land; for I seem to be an object of
  enmity to the house; I indeed will set out from this land in flight; but
  to the end that the children may be brought up by thy hand, entreat Creon
  that they may not leave this land.</p>

  <p>JAS. I know not whether I shall persuade him; but it is right to
  try.</p>

  <p>MED. But do thou then exhort thy bride to ask her father, that my
  children may not leave this country.</p>

  <p>JAS. Certainly I will, and I think at least that she will persuade
  him, if indeed she be one of the female sex.</p>

  <p>MED. I also will assist you in this task, for I will send to her
  presents which (I well know) far surpass in beauty any now among men,
  both a fine-wrought robe, and a golden-twined chaplet, my sons carrying
  them. But as quick as possible let one of my attendants bring hither
  these ornaments. Thy bride shall be blessed not in one instance, but in
  many, having met with you at least the best of husbands, and possessing
  ornaments which the sun my father's father once gave to his descendants.
  Take these nuptial presents, my sons, in your hands, and bear and present
  them to the blessed royal bride; she shall receive gifts not indeed to be
  despised.</p>

  <p>JAS. Why, O fond woman, dost thou rob thy hands of these; thinkest
  thou that the royal palace is in want of vests? in want of gold? keep
  these presents, give them not away; for if the lady esteems me of any
  value, she will prefer pleasing me to riches, I know full well.</p>

  <p>MED. But do not oppose me; gifts, they say, persuade even the Gods,<a
  name="Med_27"></a><a href="#MedN_27"><sup>[27]</sup></a> and gold is more
  powerful than a thousand arguments to men. Hers is fortune, her substance
  the God now increases, she in youth governs all. But the sentence of
  banishment on my children I would buy off with my life, not with gold
  alone. But my children, enter you the wealthy palace, to the new bride of
  your father, and my mistress, entreat her, beseech her, that you may not
  leave the land, presenting these ornaments; but this is of the greatest
  consequence, that, she receive these gifts in her own hand. Go as quick
  as possible, and may you be bearers of good tidings to your mother in
  what she desires to obtain, having succeeded favorably.</p>

  <p>CHOR. Now no longer have I any hope of life for the children, no
  longer [is there hope]; for already are they going to death. The bride
  shall receive the destructive present of the golden chaplet, she wretched
  shall receive them, and around her golden tresses shall she place the
  attire of death, having received the presents in her hands. The beauty
  and the divine glitter of the robe will persuade her to place around her
  head the golden-wrought chaplet. Already with the dead shall the bride be
  adorned; into such a net will she fall, and such a destiny will she,
  hapless woman, meet with; nor will she escape her fate. But thou, oh
  unhappy man! oh wretched bridegroom! son-in-law of princes, unknowingly
  thou bringest on thy children destruction, and on thy wife a bitter
  death; hapless man, how much art thou fallen from thy state!<a
  name="Med_28"></a><a href="#MedN_28"><sup>[28]</sup></a> But I lament for
  thy grief, O wretch, mother of these children, who wilt murder thy sons
  on account of a bridal-bed; deserting which, in defiance of thee, thy
  husband dwells with another wife.</p>

<p class="center">TUTOR, MEDEA, CHORUS.</p>

  <p>TUT. Thy sons, my mistress, are reprieved from banishment, and the
  royal bride received thy presents in her hands with pleasure, and hence
  is peace to thy children.</p>

  <p>MED. Ah!</p>

  <p>TUT. Why dost thou stand in confusion, when thou art fortunate?</p>

  <p>MED. Alas! alas!</p>

  <p>TUT. This behavior is not consonant with the message I have brought
  thee.</p>

  <p>MED. Alas! again.</p>

  <p>TUT. Have I reported any ill fortune unknowingly, and have I failed in
  my hope of being the messenger of good?</p>

  <p>MED. Thou hast said what thou hast said, I blame not thee.</p>

  <p>TUT. Why then dost thou bend down thine eye, and shed tears?</p>

  <p>MED. Strong necessity compels me, O aged man, for this the Gods and I
  deliberating ill have contrived.</p>

  <p>TUT. Be of good courage; thou also wilt return home yet through thy
  children.</p>

  <p>MED. Others first will I send to their home,<a name="Med_29"></a><a
  href="#MedN_29"><sup>[29]</sup></a> O wretched me!</p>

  <p>TUT. Thou art not the only one who art separated from thy children; it
  behooves a mortal to bear calamities with meekness.</p>

  <p>MED. I will do so; but go within the house, and prepare for the
  children what is needful for the day. O my sons, my sons, you have indeed
  a city, and a house, in which having forsaken me miserable, you shall
  dwell, ever deprived of a mother. But I am now going an exile into a
  foreign land, before I could have delight in you, and see you
  flourishing, before I could adorn your marriage, and wife, and
  nuptial-bed, and hold up the torch.<a name="Med_30"></a><a
  href="#MedN_30"><sup>[30]</sup></a> O unfortunate woman that I am, on
  account of my wayward temper. In vain then, my children, have I brought
  you up, in vain have I toiled, and been consumed with cares, suffering
  the strong agonies of child-bearing. Surely once there was a time when I
  hapless woman had many hopes in you, that you would both tend me in my
  age, and when dead would with your hands decently compose my limbs, a
  thing desired by men. But now this pleasing thought hath indeed perished;
  for deprived of you I shall pass a life of misery, and bitter to myself.
  But you will no longer behold your mother with your dear eyes, having
  passed into another state of life. Alas! alas! why do you look upon me
  with your eyes, my children? Why do ye smile that last smile? Alas! alas!
  what shall I do? for my heart is sinking. Ye females, when I behold the
  cheerful look of my children, I have no power. Farewell my counsels: I
  will take my children with me from this land. What does it avail me
  grieving their father with the ills of these, to acquire twice as much
  pain for myself? never will I at least do this. Farewell my counsels. And
  yet what do I suffer? do I wish to incur ridicule, having left my foes
  unpunished? This must be dared. But the bringing forward words of
  tenderness in my mind arises also from my cowardice. Go, my children,
  into the house; and he for whom it is not lawful to be present at my
  sacrifice, let him take care himself to keep away.<a name="Med_31"></a><a
  href="#MedN_31"><sup>[31]</sup></a> But I will not stain my hand. Alas!
  alas! do not thou then, my soul, do not thou at least perpetrate this.
  Let them escape, thou wretch, spare thy sons. There shall they live with
  us and delight thee. No, I swear by the infernal deities who dwell with
  Pluto, never shall this be, that I will give up my children to be
  insulted by my enemies. [At all events they must die, and since they
  must, I who brought them into the world will perpetrate the deed.] This
  is fully determined by fate, and shall not pass away. And now the chaplet
  is on her head, and the bride is perishing in the robes; of this I am
  well assured. But, since I am now going a most dismal path, and these
  will I send by one still more dismal, I desire to address my children:
  give, my sons, give thy right hand for thy mother to kiss. O most dear
  hand, and those lips dearest to me, and that form and noble countenance
  of my children, be ye blessed, but there;<a name="Med_32"></a><a
  href="#MedN_32"><sup>[32]</sup></a> for every thing here your father hath
  taken away. O the sweet embrace, and that soft skin, and that most
  fragrant breath of my children. Go, go; no longer am I able to look upon
  you, but am overcome by my ills. I know indeed the ills that I am about
  to dare, but my rage is master of my counsels,<a name="Med_33"></a><a
  href="#MedN_33"><sup>[33]</sup></a> which is indeed the cause of the
  greatest calamities to men.</p>

  <p>CHOR. Already have I often gone through more refined reasonings, and
  have come to greater arguments than suits the female mind to investigate;
  for we also have a muse, which dwelleth with us, for the sake of teaching
  wisdom; but not with all, for haply thou wilt find but a small number of
  the race of women out of many not ungifted with the muse.<a
  name="Med_34"></a><a href="#MedN_34"><sup>[34]</sup></a></p>

  <p>And I say that those men who are entirely free from wedlock, and have
  not begotten children, surpass in happiness those who have families;
  those indeed who are childless, through inexperience whether children are
  born a joy or anguish to men, not having them themselves, are exempt from
  much misery. But those who have a sweet blooming offspring of children in
  their house, I behold worn with care the whole time; first of all how
  they shall bring them up honorably, and how they shall leave means of
  sustenance for their children. And still after this, whether they are
  toiling for bad or good sons, this is still in darkness. But one ill to
  mortals, the last of all, I now will mention. For suppose they have both
  found sufficient store, and the bodies of their children have arrived at
  manhood, and that they are good; but if this fortune shall happen to
  them, death, bearing away their sons, vanishes with them to the shades of
  darkness. How then does it profit that the Gods heap on mortals yet this
  grief in addition to others, the most bitter of all, for the sake of
  children?</p>

<p class="center">MEDEA, MESSENGER, CHORUS.</p>

  <p>MED. For a long time waiting for the event, my friends, I am anxiously
  expecting what will be the result thence. And I see indeed one of the
  domestics of Jason coming hither, and his quickened breath shows that he
  will be the messenger of some new ill.</p>

  <p>MESS. O thou, that hast impiously perpetrated a deed of terror, Medea,
  fly, fly, leaving neither the ocean chariot,<a name="Med_35"></a><a
  href="#MedN_35"><sup>[35]</sup></a> nor the car whirling o'er the
  plain.</p>

  <p>MED. But what is done that requires this flight?</p>

  <p>MESS. The princess is just dead, and Creon her father destroyed by thy
  charms.</p>

  <p>MED. Thou hast spoken most glad tidings: and hereafter from this time
  shalt thou be among my benefactors and friends.</p>

  <p>MESS. What sayest thou? Art thou in thy senses, and not mad, lady? who
  having destroyed the king and family, rejoicest at hearing it, and
  fearest not such things?</p>

  <p>MED. I also have something to say to these words of thine at least;
  but be not hasty, my friend; but tell me how they perished, for twice as
  much delight wilt thou give me if they died miserably.</p>

  <p>MESS. As soon as thy two sons were come with their father, and had
  entered the bridal house, we servants, who were grieved at thy
  misfortunes, were delighted; and immediately there was much conversation
  in our ears, that thy husband and thou had brought the former quarrel to
  a friendly termination. One kissed the hand, another the auburn head of
  thy sons, and I also myself followed with them to the women's apartments
  through joy. But my mistress, whom we now reverence instead of thee,
  before she saw thy two sons enter, held her cheerful eyes fixed on Jason;
  afterward however she covered her eyes, and turned aside her white cheek,
  disgusted at the entrance of thy sons; but thy husband quelled the anger
  and rage of the young bride, saying this; Be not angry with thy friends,
  but cease from thy rage, and turn again thy face, esteeming those as
  friends, whom thy husband does. But receive the gifts, and ask thy father
  to give up the sentence of banishment against these children for my sake.
  But when she saw the ornaments, she refused not, but promised her husband
  every thing; and before thy sons and their father were gone far from the
  house, she took and put on the variegated robes, and having placed the
  golden chaplet around her tresses she arranges her hair in the radiant
  mirror, smiling at the lifeless image of her person. And after, having
  risen from her seat, she goes across the chamber, elegantly tripping with
  snow-white foot; rejoicing greatly in the presents, looking much and
  oftentimes with her eyes on her outstretched neck.<a name="Med_36"></a><a
  href="#MedN_36"><sup>[36]</sup></a> After that however there was a sight
  of horror to behold. For having changed color, she goes staggering back
  trembling in her limbs, and is scarce in time to prevent herself from
  falling on the ground, by sinking into a chair. And some aged female
  attendant, when she thought that the wrath either of Pan or some other
  Deity<a name="Med_37"></a><a href="#MedN_37"><sup>[37]</sup></a> had
  visited her, offered up the invocation, before at least she sees the
  white foam bursting from her mouth, and her mistress rolling her eyeballs
  from their sockets, and the blood no longer in the flesh; then she sent
  forth a loud shriek of far different sound from the strain of
  supplication; and straightway one rushed to the apartments of her father,
  but another to her newly-married husband, to tell the calamity befallen
  the bride, and all the house was filled with frequent hurryings to and
  fro. And by this time a swift runner, exerting his limbs, might have
  reached<a name="Med_38"></a><a href="#MedN_38"><sup>[38]</sup></a> the
  goal of the course of six plethra;<a name="Med_39"></a><a
  href="#MedN_39"><sup>[39]</sup></a> but she, wretched woman, from being
  speechless, and from a closed eye having groaned deeply writhed in agony;
  for a double pest was warring against her. The golden chaplet indeed
  placed on her head was sending forth a stream of all-devouring fire
  wonderful to behold, but the fine-wrought robes, the presents of thy
  sons, were devouring the white flesh of the hapless woman. But she having
  started from her seat flies, all on fire, tossing her hair and head on
  this side and that side, desirous of shaking off the chaplet; but the
  golden wreath firmly kept its hold; but the fire, when she shook her
  hair, blazed out with double fury, and she sinks upon the ground overcome
  by her sufferings, difficult for any one except her father to recognize.
  For neither was the expression of her eyes clear, nor her noble
  countenance; but the blood was dropping from the top of her head mixed
  with fire. But her flesh was dropping off her bones, as the tear from the
  pine-tree, by the hidden fangs of the poison; a sight of horror. But all
  feared to touch the body, for we had her fate to warn us. But the hapless
  father, through ignorance of her suffering, having come with haste into
  the apartment, falls on the corpse, and groans immediately; and having
  folded his arms round her, kisses her, saying these words; O miserable
  child, what Deity hath thus cruelly destroyed thee? who makes an aged
  father bowing to the tomb<a name="Med_40"></a><a
  href="#MedN_40"><sup>[40]</sup></a> bereaved of thee? Alas me! let me die
  with thee, my child. But after he had ceased from his lamentations and
  cries, desiring to raise his aged body, he was held, as the ivy by the
  boughs of the laurel, by the fine-wrought robes; and dreadful was the
  struggle, for he wished to raise his knee, but she held him back; but if
  he drew himself away by force he tore the aged flesh from his bones. But
  at length the wretched man swooned away, and gave up his life; for no
  longer was he able to endure the agony. But they lie corses, the daughter
  and aged father near one another; a calamity that demands tears. And let
  thy affairs indeed be not matter for my words; for thou thyself wilt know
  a refuge from punishment. But the affairs of mortals not now for the
  first time I deem a shadow, and I would venture to say that those persons
  who seem to be wise and are researchers of arguments, these I say, run
  into the greatest folly. For no mortal man is happy; but wealth pouring
  in, one man may be more fortunate than another, but happy he can not
  be.</p>

  <p>CHOR. The Deity, it seems, will in this day justly heap on Jason a
  variety of ills. O hapless lady, how we pity thy sufferings, daughter of
  Creon, who art gone to the house of darkness, through thy marriage with
  Jason.</p>

  <p>MED. The deed is determined on by me, my friends, to slay my children
  as soon as possible, and to hasten from this land; and not by delaying to
  give my sons for another hand more hostile to murder. But come, be armed,
  my heart; why do we delay to do dreadful but necessary deeds? Come, O
  wretched hand of mine, grasp the sword, grasp it, advance to the bitter
  goal of life, and be not cowardly, nor remember thy children how dear
  they are, how thou broughtest them into the world; but for this short day
  at least forget thy children; hereafter lament. For although thou slayest
  them, nevertheless they at least were dear, but I a wretched woman.</p>

  <p>CHOR. O thou earth, and thou all-illuming beam of the sun, look down
  upon, behold this abandoned woman, before she move her blood-stained hand
  itself about to inflict the blow against her children; for from thy
  golden race they sprung; but fearful is it for the blood of Gods to fall
  by the hand of man. But do thou, O heaven-born light, restrain her, stop
  her, remove from this house this blood-stained and miserable Erinnys
  agitated by the Furies. The care of thy children perishes in vain, and in
  vain hast thou produced a dear race, O thou who didst leave the most
  inhospitable entrance of the Cyanean rocks, the Symplegades. Hapless
  woman, why does such grievous rage settle on thy mind; and hostile
  slaughter ensue? For kindred pollutions are difficult of purification to
  mortals; correspondent calamities falling from the Gods to the earth upon
  the houses of the murderers.<a name="Med_41"></a><a
  href="#MedN_41"><sup>[41]</sup></a></p>

  <p>FIRST SON. (<i>within</i>) Alas! what shall I do? whither shall I fly
  from my mother's hand?</p>

  <p>SECOND SON. I know not, dearest brother, for we perish.</p>

  <p>CHOR. Hearest thou the cry? hearest thou the children? O wretch, O
  ill-fated woman! Shall I enter the house? It seems right to me to ward
  off the murderous blow from the children.</p>

  <p>SONS. Nay, by the Gods assist us, for it is in needful time; since now
  at least are we near the destruction of the sword.</p>

  <p>CHOR. Miserable woman, art thou then a rock, or iron, who cuttest down
  with death by thine own hand the fair crop of children which thou
  producedst thyself? one indeed I hear of, one woman of those of old, who
  laid violent hands on her children, Ino, maddened by the Gods when the
  wife of Jove sent her in banishment from her home; and she miserable
  woman falls into the sea through the impious murder of her children,
  directing her foot over the sea-shore, and dying with her two sons, there
  she perished! what then I pray can be more dreadful than this? O thou bed
  of woman, fruitful in ills, how many evils hast thou already brought to
  men!</p>

<p class="center">JASON, CHORUS.</p>

  <p>JAS. Ye females, who stand near this mansion, is she who hath done
  these deeds of horror, Medea, in this house; or hath she withdrawn
  herself in flight? For now it is necessary for her either to be hidden
  beneath the earth, or to raise her winged body into the vast expanse of
  air, if she would not suffer vengeance from the king's house. Does she
  trust that after having slain the princes of this land, she shall herself
  escape from this house with impunity?&mdash;But I have not such care for
  her as for my children; for they whom she has injured will punish her.
  But I came to preserve my children's life, lest [Creon's] relations by
  birth do any injury,<a name="Med_42"></a><a
  href="#MedN_42"><sup>[42]</sup></a> avenging the impious murder
  perpetrated by their mother.</p>

  <p>CHOR. Unhappy man! thou knowest not at what misery thou hast arrived,
  Jason, or else thou wouldest not have uttered these words.</p>

  <p>JAS. What is this, did she wish to slay me also?</p>

  <p>CHOR. Thy children are dead by their mother's hand.</p>

  <p>JAS. Alas me! What wilt thou say? how hast thou killed me, woman!</p>

  <p>CHOR. Think now of thy sons as no longer living.</p>

  <p>JAS. Where did she slay them, within or without the house?</p>

  <p>CHOR. Open those doors, and thou wilt see the slaughter of thy
  sons.</p>

  <p>JAS. Undo the bars, as quick as possible, attendants; unloose the
  hinges, that I may see this double evil, my sons slain, and may punish
  her.</p>

  <p>MED. Why dost thou shake and unbolt these gates, seeking the dead and
  me who did the deed. Cease from this labor; but if thou wantest aught
  with me, speak if thou wishest any thing; but never shall thou touch me
  with thy hands; such a chariot the sun my father's father gives me, a
  defense from the hostile hand.<a name="Med_43"></a><a
  href="#MedN_43"><sup>[43]</sup></a></p>

  <p>JAS. O thou abomination! thou most detested woman, both by the Gods
  and by me, and by all the race of man; who hast dared to plunge the sword
  in thine own children, thou who bore them, and hast destroyed me
  childless. And having done this thou beholdest both the sun and the
  earth, having dared a most impious deed. Mayest thou perish! but I am now
  wise, not being so then when I brought thee from thy house and from a
  foreign land to a Grecian habitation, a great pest, traitress to thy
  father and the land that nurtured thee. But the Gods have sent thy evil
  genius on me. For having slain thy brother at the altar, thou embarkedst
  on board the gallant vessel Argo. Thou begannest indeed with such deeds
  as these; and being wedded to me, and bearing me children, thou hast
  destroyed them on account of another bed and marriage. There is not one
  Grecian woman who would have dared a deed like this, in preference to
  whom at least, I thought worthy to wed thee, an alliance hateful and
  destructive to me, a lioness, no woman, having a nature more savage than
  the Tuscan Scylla. But I can not gall thy heart with ten thousand
  reproaches, such shameless confidence is implanted in thee. Go, thou
  worker of ill, and stained with the blood of thy children. But for me it
  remains to bewail my fate, who shall neither enjoy my new nuptials, nor
  shall I have it in my power to address while alive my sons whom I begot
  and educated, but I have lost them.</p>

  <p>MED. Surely I could make long reply to these words, if the Sire
  Jupiter did not know what treatment thou receivedst from me, and what
  thou didst in return; but you were mistaken, when you expected, having
  dishonored my bed, to lead a life of pleasure, mocking me, and so was the
  princess, and so was Creon, who proposed the match to thee, when he
  expected to drive me from this land with impunity. Wherefore, if thou
  wilt, call me lioness, and Scylla who dwelt in the Tuscan plain. For thy
  heart, as is right, I have wounded.</p>

  <p>JAS. And thou thyself grievest at least, and art a sharer in these
  ills.</p>

  <p>MED. Be assured of that; but this lessens<a name="Med_44"></a><a
  href="#MedN_44"><sup>[44]</sup></a> the grief, that thou canst not mock
  me.</p>

  <p>JAS. My children, what a wicked mother have ye found!</p>

  <p>MED. My sons, how did ye perish by your father's fault!</p>

  <p>JAS. Nevertheless my hand slew them not.</p>

  <p>MED. But injury, and thy new nuptials.</p>

  <p>JAS. And on account of thy bed didst thou think fit to slay them?</p>

  <p>MED. Dost thou deem this a slight evil to a woman?</p>

  <p>JAS. Whoever at least is modest; but in thee is every ill.</p>

  <p>MED. These are no longer living, for this will gall thee.</p>

  <p>JAS. These are living, alas me! avenging furies on thy head.</p>

  <p>MED. The Gods know who began the injury.</p>

  <p>JAS. They know indeed thy execrable mind.</p>

  <p>Meo. Thou art hateful to me, and I detest thy bitter speech.</p>

  <p>JAS. And I in sooth thine; the separation at least is without
  pain.</p>

  <p>MED. How then? what shall I do? for I also am very desirous.</p>

  <p>JAS. Suffer me, I beg, to bury and mourn over these dead bodies.</p>

  <p>MED. Never indeed; since I will bury them with this hand bearing them
  to the shrine of Juno, the Goddess guardian of the citadel, that no one
  of my enemies may insult them, tearing up their graves. But in this land
  of Sisyphus will I institute in addition to this a solemn festival and
  sacrifices hereafter to expiate this unhallowed murder. But I myself will
  go to the land of Erectheus, to dwell with Ægeus son of Pandion. But
  thou, wretch, as is fit, shalt die wretchedly, struck on thy head with a
  relic of thy ship Argo, having seen the bitter end of my marriage.</p>

  <p>JAS. But may the Fury of the children, and Justice the avenger of
  murder, destroy thee.</p>

  <p>MED. But what God or Deity hears thee, thou perjured man, and traitor
  to the rights of hospitality?</p>

  <p>JAS. Ah! thou abominable woman, and murderer of thy children.</p>

  <p>MED. Go to thy home, and bury thy wife.</p>

  <p>JAS. I go, even deprived of both my children.</p>

  <p>MED. Thou dost not yet mourn enough: stay and grow old.<a
  name="Med_45"></a><a href="#MedN_45"><sup>[45]</sup></a></p>

  <p>JAS. Oh my dearest sons!</p>

  <p>MED. To their mother at least, but not to thee.</p>

  <p>JAS. And yet thou slewest them.</p>

  <p>MED. To grieve thee.</p>

  <p>JAS. Alas, alas! I hapless man long to kiss the dear mouths of my
  children.</p>

  <p>MED. Now them addressest, now salutest them, formerly rejecting them
  with scorn.</p>

  <p>JAS. Grant me, by the Gods, to touch the soft skin of my sons.</p>

  <p>MED. It is not possible. Thy words are thrown away in vain.</p>

  <p>JAS. Dost thou hear this, O Jove, how I am rejected, and what I suffer
  from this accursed and child-destroying lioness? But as much indeed as is
  in my power and I am able, I lament and mourn over these; calling the
  Gods to witness, that having slain my children, thou preventest me from
  touching them with my hands, and from burying the bodies, whom, oh that I
  had never begotten, and seen them thus destroyed by thee.</p>

  <p>CHOR. Jove is the dispenser of various fates in heaven, and the Gods
  perform many things contrary to our expectations, and those things which
  we looked for are not accomplished; but the God hath brought to pass
  things unthought of. In such manner hath this affair ended.</p>

  <p>Theseus was the son of Othra and Neptune, and king of the Athenians;
  and having married Hippolyta, one of the Amazons, he begat Hippolytus,
  who excelled in beauty and chastity. When his wife died, he married, for
  his second wife, Phædra, a Cretan, daughter of Minos, king of Crete, and
  Pasiphaë. Theseus, in consequence of having slain Pallas, one of his
  kinsmen, goes into banishment, with his wife, to Tr&#339;zene, where it
  happened that Hippolytus was being brought up by Pittheus: but Phædra
  having seen the youth was desperately enamored, not that she was
  incontinent, but in order to fulfill the anger of Venus, who, having
  determined to destroy Hippolytus on account of his chastity, brought her
  plans to a conclusion. She, concealing her disease, at length was
  compelled to declare it to her nurse, who had promised to relieve her,
  and who, though against her inclination, carried her words to the youth.
  Phædra, having learned that he was exasperated, eluded the nurse, and
  hung herself. At which time Theseus having arrived, and wishing to take
  her down that was strangled, found a letter attached to her, throughout
  which she accused Hippolytus of a design on her virtue. And he, believing
  what was written, ordered Hippolytus to go into banishment, and put up a
  prayer to Neptune, in compliance with which the god destroyed Hippolytus.
  But Diana declared to Theseus every thing that had happened, and blamed
  not Phædra, but comforted him, bereaved of his child and wife, and
  promised to institute honors in the place to Hippolytus.</p>

  <p>The scene of the play is laid in Tr&#339;zene. It was acted in the
  archonship of Ameinon, in the fourth year of the 87th Olympiad. Euripides
  first, Jophon second, Jon third. This Hippolytus is the second of that
  name, and is called <span lang="el"
  title="STEPHANIAS">&#x3A3;&#x3A4;&#x395;&#x3A6;&#x391;&#x39D;&#x399;&#x391;&#x3A3;</span>:
  but it appears to have been written the latest, for what was unseemly and
  deserved blame is corrected in this play. The play is ranked among the
  first.</p>

<h2>HIPPOLYTUS.</h2>

<hr class="short" />

<p class="center">VENUS.</p>

  <p>Great in the sight of mortals, and not without a name am I the Goddess
  Venus, and in heaven: and of as many as dwell within the ocean and the
  boundaries of Atlas, beholding the light of the sun, those indeed, who
  reverence my authority, I advance to honor; but overthrow as many as hold
  themselves high toward me. For this is in sooth a property inherent even
  in the race of the Gods, that "they rejoice when honored by men." But
  quickly will I show the truth of these words: for the son of Theseus,
  born of the Amazon, Hippolytus, pupil of the chaste Pittheus, alone of
  the inhabitants of this land of Tr&#339;zene, says that I am of deities
  the vilest, and rejects the bridal bed, and will have nothing to do with
  marriage. But Dian, the sister of Ph&#339;bus, daughter of Jove, he
  honors, esteeming her the greatest of deities. And through the green wood
  ever accompanying the virgin, with his swift dogs he clears the beasts
  from off the earth, having formed a fellowship greater than mortal ought.
  This indeed I grudge him not; for wherefore should I? but wherein he has
  erred toward me, I will avenge me on Hippolytus this very day: and having
  cleared most of the difficulties beforehand,<a name="Hipp_1"></a><a
  href="#HippN_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> I need not much labor. For Phædra, his
  father's noble wife, having seen him, (as he was going once from the
  house of Pittheus to the land of Pandion, in order to see and afterward
  be fully admitted to the hallowed mysteries,) was smitten in her heart
  with fierce love by my design. And even before she came to this land of
  Tr&#339;zene, at the very rock of Pallas that overlooks this land, she
  raised a temple to Venus, loving an absent love; and gave out
  afterward,<a name="Hipp_2"></a><a href="#HippN_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> that
  the Goddess was honored with her temple for Hippolytus's sake. But now
  since Theseus has left the land of Cecrops, in order to avoid the
  pollution of the murder of the sons of Pallas, and is sailing to this
  land with his wife, having submitted to a year's banishment from his
  people; there indeed groaning and stricken with the stings of love, the
  wretched woman perishes in secret; and not one of her domestics is
  conscious of her malady. But this love must by no means fall to the
  ground in this way: but I will open the matter to Theseus, and it shall
  become manifest. And him that is our enemy shall the father kill with
  imprecations, which Neptune, king of the ocean, granted as a privilege to
  Theseus, that he should make no prayer thrice to the God in vain. But
  Phædra dies, an illustrious woman indeed, yet still [she must die]; for I
  will not make her ills of that high consequence, that will hinder my
  enemies from giving me such full vengeance as may content me. But, as I
  see the son of Theseus coming, having left the toil of the chase, I will
  depart from this spot. But with him a numerous train of attendants
  following behind raise a clamor, praising the Goddess Dian with hymns,
  for he knows not that the gates of hell are opened, and that this day is
  the last he beholds.</p>

<p class="center">HIPPOLYTUS, ATTENDANTS.</p>

  <p>HIPP. Follow, follow, singing the heavenly Dian, daughter of Jove;
  Dian, under whose protection we are.</p>

  <p>ATT. Holy, holy, most hallowed offspring of Jove, hail! hail! O Dian,
  daughter of Latona and of Jove, most beauteous by far of virgins, who,
  born of an illustrious sire, in the vast heaven dwellest in the palace of
  Jove, that mansion rich in gold.</p>

  <p>HIPP. Hail, O most beauteous, most beauteous of virgins in Olympus,
  Dian! For thee, my mistress, bear I this wreathed garland from the pure
  mead, where neither does the shepherd think fit to feed his flocks, nor
  yet came iron there, but the bee ranges over the pure and vernal mead,
  and Reverence waters it with river dews. Whosoever has chastity, not that
  which is taught in schools, but that which is by nature, for this
  description of persons it is lawful thence to pluck, but for the evil it
  is not lawful.<a name="Hipp_3"></a><a href="#HippN_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>
  But, O my dear mistress, receive this wreath to bind your golden tresses
  from a pious hand. For to me alone of mortals is allowed this privilege.
  With thee I am both present, and exchange words with thee, hearing thy
  voice, but not seeing thy countenance. But may I finish the last turn of
  my course of life, even as I began.</p>

  <p>ATT. O king, (for the Gods alone ought we to call Lords,) will you
  hear somewhat from me, who advise you well?</p>

  <p>HIPP. Most certainly, or else I should not seem wise.</p>

  <p>ATT. Knowest thou then the law, which is established among men?</p>

  <p>HIPP. I know not; but what is the one, about which thou askest me?</p>

  <p>ATT. To hate haughtiness, and that which is disagreeable to all.</p>

  <p>HIPP. And rightly; for what haughty mortal is not odious?</p>

  <p>ATT. And in the affable is there any charm?</p>

  <p>HIPP. A very great one indeed, and gain with little toil.</p>

  <p>ATT. Dost thou suppose that the same thing holds also among the
  Gods?</p>

  <p>HIPP. Certainly, forasmuch as we mortals use the laws of the Gods.</p>

  <p>ATT. How is it then that thou addressest not a venerable Goddess?</p>

  <p>HIPP. Whom? but take heed that thy mouth err not.<a
  name="Hipp_4"></a><a href="#HippN_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>

  <p>ATT. Venus, who hath her station at thy gates.</p>

  <p>HIPP. I, who am chaste, salute her at a distance.</p>

  <p>ATT. Venerable is she, however, and of note among mortals.</p>

  <p>HIPP. Different Gods and men are objects of regard to different
  persons.</p>

  <p>ATT. May you be blest, having as much sense as you require.<a
  name="Hipp_5"></a><a href="#HippN_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>

  <p>HIPP. No one of the Gods, that is worshiped by night, delights me.</p>

  <p>ATT. My son, we must conform to the honors of the Gods.</p>

  <p>HIPP. Depart, my companions, and having entered the house, prepare the
  viands: delightful after the chase is the full table.&mdash;And I must
  rub down my horses, that having yoked them to the car, when I am satiated
  with the repast, I may give them their proper exercise. But to your Venus
  I bid a long farewell.</p>

  <p>ATT. But we, for one must not imitate the young, having our thoughts
  such, as it becomes slaves to give utterance to, will adore thy image, O
  Venus, our mistress; but thou shouldest pardon, if any one having intense
  feelings of mind by reason of his youth, speak foolishly: seem not to
  hear these things, for Gods must needs be wiser than men.</p>

  <p>CHOR. There is a rock near the ocean,<a name="Hipp_6"></a><a
  href="#HippN_6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> distilling water, which sends forth
  from its precipices a flowing fountain, wherein they dip their urns;
  where was a friend of mine wetting the purple vests in the dew of the
  stream, and she laid them down on the back of the warm sunny cliff: from
  hence first came to me the report concerning my mistress, that she, worn
  with the bed of sickness, keeps her person within the house, and that
  fine vests veil her auburn head. And I hear that she this day for the
  third keeps her body untouched by the fruit of Ceres, [which she receives
  not] into her ambrosial mouth, wishing in secret suffering to hasten to
  the unhappy goal of death. For heaven-possessed, O lady, or whether by
  Pan, or by Hecate, or by the venerable Corybantes, or by the mother who
  haunts the mountains, thou art raving. But thou art thus tormented on
  account of some fault committed against the Cretan huntress, profane
  because of unoffered sacred cakes. For she goes through the sea and
  beyond the land on the eddies of the watery brine. Or some one in the
  palace misguides thy noble husband, the chief of the Athenians, by secret
  concubinage in thy bed. Or some sailor who put from port at Crete, hath
  sailed to the harbor most friendly to mariners, bringing some message to
  the queen; and, confined to her couch, she is bound in soul by sorrow for
  its sufferings. But wretched helplessness is wont to dwell with the
  wayward constitution of women, both on account of their throes and their
  loss of reason. Once through my womb shot this thrill, but I invoked the
  heavenly Dian, who gives easy throes, who presides over the bow, and to
  me she came ever much to be blessed, as well as the other Gods. But lo!
  the old nurse is bringing her out of the palace before the gates; and the
  sad cloud upon her brows is increased. What it can possibly be, my soul
  desires to know, with what can be afflicted the person of the queen, of
  color so changed.<a name="Hipp_7"></a><a

<p class="center">PHÆDRA, NURSE, CHORUS.</p>

  <p>Alas! the evils of men, and their odious diseases! what shall I do for
  thee? and what not do? lo! here is the clear light for thee, here the
  air: and now is thy couch whereon thou liest sick removed from out of the
  house: for every word you spoke was to come hither; but soon you will be
  in a hurry to go to your chamber back again: for you are soon changed,
  and are pleased with nothing. Nor does what is present delight you, but
  what is not present you think more agreeable. It is a better thing to be
  sick, than to tend the sick: the one is a simple ill, but with the other
  is joined both pain of mind and toil of hands. But the whole life of men
  is full of grief, nor is there rest from toils. But whatever else there
  be more dear than life, darkness enveloping hides it in clouds. Hence we
  appear to dote on this present state, because it gleams on earth, through
  inexperience of another life, and the non-appearance of the things
  beneath the earth. But we are blindly carried away by fables.</p>

  <p>PHÆ. Raise my body, place my head upright&mdash;I am faint in the
  joints of my limbs, my friends, lay hold of my fair-formed hands, O
  attendants&mdash;The dressing on my head is heavy for me to
  support&mdash;take it off, let flow my ringlets on my shoulders.</p>

  <p>NUR. Be of good courage, my child, and do not thus painfully shift
  [the posture of] your body. But you will bear your sickness more easily
  both with quiet, and with a noble temper, for it is necessary for mortals
  to suffer misery.</p>

  <p>PHÆ. Alas! alas! would I could draw from the dewy fountain the drink
  of pure waters, and that under the alders, and in the leafy mead
  reclining I might rest!</p>

  <p>NUR. O my child, what sayest thou? Wilt thou not desist from uttering
  these things before the multitude, blurting forth a speech of madness?<a
  name="Hipp_8"></a><a href="#HippN_8"><sup>[8]</sup></a></p>

  <p>PHÆ. Bear me to the mountain&mdash;I will go to the wood, and by the
  pine-trees, where tread the dogs the slayers of beasts, pursuing the
  dappled hinds&mdash;By the Gods I long to cheer on the hounds, and by the
  side of my auburn hair to hurl the Thessalian javelin bearing the lanced
  weapon in my hand.</p>

  <p>NUR. Wherefore in the name of heaven, my child, do you hanker after
  these things? wherefore have you any anxiety for hunting? and wherefore
  do you long for the fountain streams? for by the towers there is a
  perpetual flow of water, whence may be your draught.</p>

  <p>PHÆ. O Dian, mistress of Limna near the sea, and of the exercises of
  the rattling steeds, would that I were on thy plains, breaking the
  Henetian colts.</p>

  <p>NUR. Wherefore again have you madly uttered this word? at one time
  having ascended the mountain you set forth with the desire of hunting;
  but now again you long for the colts on the wave-beaten sands. These
  things demand much skill in prophecy [to find out], who it is of the Gods
  that torments thee, O lady, and strikes mad thy senses.</p>

  <p>PHÆ. Wretch that I am, what then have I committed? whither have I
  wandered from my sound mind? I have gone mad; I have fallen by the evil
  influence of some God. Alas! alas! unhappy that I am&mdash;Nurse, cover
  my head again, for I am ashamed of the things I have spoken: cover me; a
  tear trickles down my eyes, and my sight is turned to my disgrace. For to
  be in one's right mind causes grief: but madness is an ill; yet it is
  better to perish, nothing knowing of one's ills.</p>

  <p>NUR. I cover thee&mdash;but when in sooth will death cover my body?
  Length of life teaches me many things. For it behooves mortals to form
  moderate friendships with each other, and not to the very marrow of the
  soul: and the affections of the mind should be dissoluble, and so that we
  can slacken them, or tighten.<a name="Hipp_9"></a><a
  href="#HippN_9"><sup>[9]</sup></a> But that one soul should feel pangs
  for two, as I now grieve for her, is a heavy burden. The concerns of life
  carried to too great an extent, they say, bring rather destruction than
  delight, and are rather at enmity with health. Thus I praise what is in
  extreme less than <i>the sentiment of</i> "Nothing in excess;" and the
  wise will agree with me.</p>

  <p>CHOR. O aged woman, faithful nurse of the queen Phædra, we see indeed
  the wretched state of this lady, but it is not clear what her disease is:
  but we would wish to inquire and hear from you.</p>

  <p>NUR. I know not by my inquiries; for she is not willing to speak.</p>

  <p>CHOR. Nor what is the origin of these pangs?</p>

  <p>NUR. You come to the same result; for she is silent with regard to all
  these things.</p>

  <p>CHOR. How feeble she is, and wasted away as to her body!</p>

  <p>NUR. How could it be otherwise, seeing that she has abstained from
  food these three days?</p>

  <p>CHOR. From the violence of her calamity is it, or does she endeavor to
  die?</p>

  <p>NUR. To die; but she fasts to the dissolution of her life.</p>

  <p>CHOR. An extraordinary thing you have been telling me, if this conduct
  meets the approbation of her husband.</p>

  <p>NUR. [He nothing knows,] for she conceals this calamity, and denies
  that she is ill.</p>

  <p>CHOR. But does he not guess it, looking into her face?</p>

  <p>NUR. [How should he?] for he is out of this country.</p>

  <p>CHOR. But do you not urge it as a matter of necessity, when you
  endeavor to ascertain her disease and the wandering of her senses?</p>

  <p>NUR. I have tried every thing, and have made no further advances. I
  will not however abate even now from my zeal, so that you being present
  may bear witness with me, how I behave to my mistress when in
  calamity&mdash;Come, dear child, let us both forget our former
  conversations; and be both thou more mild, having smoothed that
  contracted brow, and altered the bent of your design; and I giving up
  that wherein I did not do right to follow thee, will have recourse to
  other better words. And if indeed you are ill with any of those maladies
  that are not to be mentioned, these women here can allay the disease: but
  if it may be related to men, tell it, that the thing may be mentioned to
  physicians.&mdash;Well! why art thou silent? It doth not behoove thee to
  be silent, my child, but either shouldst thou convict me, if aught I say
  amiss, or yield to words well spoken.&mdash;Say something&mdash;look
  hither&mdash;O wretch that I am! Ladies, in vain do we undergo these
  toils, while we are as far off from our purpose as before: for neither
  then was she softened by our words, nor now does she give heed to us.
  Still however know (now then be more obstinate than the sea) that, if
  thou shalt die, thou wilt betray thy children, who will have no share in
  their paternal mansion. I swear by the warlike queen the Amazon, who
  brought forth a lord over thy children, base-born yet of noble
  sentiments, thou knowest him well, Hippolytus.</p>

  <p>PHÆ. Ah me!</p>

  <p>NUR. This touches thee.</p>

  <p>PHÆ. You have destroyed me, nurse, and by the Gods I entreat thee
  henceforth to be silent with respect to this man.</p>

  <p>NUR. Do you see? you judge well indeed, but judging well you are not
  willing both to assist your children and to save your own life.</p>

  <p>PHÆ. I love my children; but I am wintering in the storm of another
  misfortune.</p>

  <p>NUR. You have your hands, my child, pure from blood.</p>

  <p>PHÆ. My hands are pure, but my mind has some pollution.</p>

  <p>NUR. What! from some calamity brought on you by any of your
  enemies?</p>

  <p>PHÆ. A friend destroys me against my will, himself unwilling.</p>

  <p>NUR. Has Theseus sinned any sin against thee?</p>

  <p>PHÆ. Would that I never be discovered to have injured him.</p>

  <p>NUR. What then this dreadful thing that impels thee to die?</p>

  <p>PHÆ. Suffer me to err, for against thee I err not.</p>

  <p>NUR. Not willingly [dost thou do so,] but 'tis through thee that I
  shall perish.<a name="Hipp_10"></a><a

  <p>PHÆ. Ills to thyself wilt thou hear, O wretched woman, if thou shalt
  hear these ills.</p>

  <p>NUR. [Still will I cling:] for what greater evil can befall me than to
  lose thee?</p>

  <p>PHÆ. You will be undone.<a name="Hipp_11"></a><a
  href="#HippN_11"><sup>[11]</sup></a> The thing however brings honor to
  me.</p>

  <p>NUR. And dost thou then hide what is useful, when I beseech thee?</p>

  <p>PHÆ. <i>Yes</i>, for from base things we devise things noble.</p>

  <p>NUR. Wilt not thou, then, appear more noble by telling it?</p>

  <p>PHÆ. Depart, by the Gods, and let go my hand!</p>

  <p>NUR. No in sooth, since thou givest me not the boon that were
  right.</p>

  <p>PHÆ. I will give it; for I have respect unto the reverence of thy
  hand.</p>

  <p>NUR. Now will I be silent: for hence is it yours to speak.</p>

  <p>PHÆ. O wretched mother, what a love didst thou love!</p>

  <p>NUR. That which she had for the bull, my child, or what is this thou
  meanest?</p>

  <p>PHÆ. Thou, too, O wretched sister, wife of Bacchus!</p>

  <p>NUR. Child, what ails thee? thou speakest ill against thy
  relations.</p>

  <p>PHÆ. And I the third, how unhappily I perish!</p>

  <p>NUR. I am struck dumb with amazement. Whither will thy speech
  tend?</p>

  <p>PHÆ. <i>To that point</i>, whence we have not now lately become
  unfortunate.</p>

  <p>NUR. I know not a whit further of the things I wish to hear.</p>

  <p>PHÆ. Alas! would thou couldst speak the things which I must speak.</p>

  <p>NUR. I am no prophetess so as to know clearly things hidden.</p>

  <p>PHÆ. What is that thing, which they do call men's loving!<a
  name="Hipp_12"></a><a href="#HippN_12"><sup>[12]</sup></a></p>

  <p>NUR. The same, my child, a most delightful thing, and painful
  withal.</p>

  <p>PHÆ. One of the two feelings I must perceive.</p>

  <p>NUR. What say'st? Thou lovest, my child? What man!</p>

  <p>PHÆ. Him whoever he is,<a name="Hipp_13"></a><a

  <p>NUR. Hippolytus dost thou say?</p>

  <p>PHÆ. From thyself, not me, you hear&mdash;this name.</p>

  <p>NUR. Ah me! what wilt thou go on to say? my child, how hast thou
  destroyed me! Ladies, this is not to be borne; I will not endure to live,
  hateful is the day, hateful the light I behold. I will hurl myself down,
  I will rid me of this body: I will remove from life to
  death&mdash;farewell&mdash;I no longer am. For the chaste are in love
  with what is evil, not willingly indeed, yet still [they love.] Venus
  then is no deity, but if there be aught mightier than deity, that is she,
  who hath destroyed both this my mistress, and me, and the whole
  house.</p>

  <p>CHOR. Thou didst hear, O thou didst hear the queen lamenting her
  wretched sufferings that should not be heard. Dear lady, may I perish
  before I come to thy state of mind! Alas me! alas! alas! O hapless for
  these pangs! O the woes that attend on mortals! Thou art undone, thou
  hast disclosed thy evils to the light. What time is this that has
  eternally<a name="Hipp_14"></a><a href="#HippN_14"><sup>[14]</sup></a>
  awaited thee? Some new misfortune will happen to the house. And no longer
  is it obscure where the fortune of Venus sets, O wretched Cretan
  daughter.</p>

  <p>PHÆ. Women of Tr&#339;zene, who inhabit this extreme frontier of the
  land of Pelops. Often at other times in the long season of night have I
  thought in what manner the life of mortals is depraved.<a
  name="Hipp_15"></a><a href="#HippN_15"><sup>[15]</sup></a> And to me they
  seem to do ill, not from the nature of their minds, for many have good
  thoughts, but thus must we view these things. What things are good we
  understand and know, but practice not; some from idleness, and others
  preferring some other pleasures to what is right: for there are many
  pleasures in life-long prates, and indolence, a pleasing ill, and shame;
  but there are two, the one indeed not base, but the other the weight that
  overthrows houses, but if the occasion on which each is used, were clear,
  the two things would not have the same letters. Knowing them as I did
  these things beforehand, by no drug did I think I should so far destroy
  these <i>sentiments</i>, as to fall into an opposite way of thinking. But
  I will also tell you the course of my determinations. After that love had
  wounded me, I considered how best I might endure it. I began therefore
  from this time to be silent, and to conceal this disease. For no
  confidence can be placed in the tongue, which knows to advise the
  thoughts of other men, but itself from itself has very many evils. But in
  the second place, I meditated to bear well my madness conquering it by my
  chastity. But in the third place, since by these means I was not able to
  subdue Venus, it appeared to me best to die: no one will gainsay this
  resolution. For may it be my lot, neither to be concealed where I do
  noble deeds, nor to have many witnesses, where I act basely. Besides this
  I knew I was a woman&mdash;a thing hated by all. O may she most miserably
  perish who first began to pollute the marriage-bed with other men! From
  noble families first arose this evil among women: for when base things
  appear right to those who are accounted good, surely they will appear so
  to the bad. I hate moreover those women who are chaste in their language
  indeed, but secretly have in them no good deeds of boldness: who, how, I
  pray, O Venus my revered mistress, look they on the faces of their
  husbands, nor dread the darkness that aided their deeds, and the ceilings
  of the house, lest they should some time or other utter a voice? For this
  bare idea kills me, friends, lest I should ever be discovered to have
  disgraced my husband, or my children, whom I brought forth; but free,
  happy in liberty of speech may they inhabit the city of illustrious
  Athens, in their mother glorious! For it enslaves a man, though he be
  valiant-hearted, when he is conscious of his mother's or his father's
  misdeeds. But this alone they say in endurance compeers with life, an
  honest and good mind, to whomsoever it belong. But Time, when it so
  chance, holding up the mirror as to a young virgin, shows forth the bad,
  among whom may I be never seen!</p>

  <p>CHOR. Alas! alas! In every way how fair is chastity, and how goodly a
  report has it among men!</p>

  <p>NUR. My mistress, just now indeed thy calamity coming upon me
  unawares, gave me a dreadful alarm. But now I perceive I was weak; and
  somehow or other among mortals second thoughts are the wisest. For thou
  hast not suffered any thing excessive nor extraordinary, but the anger of
  the Goddess hath fallen upon thee. Thou lovest&mdash;what wonder this?
  with many mortals.&mdash;And then will you lose your life for love? There
  is then no advantage for those who love others, nor to those who may
  hereafter, if they must needs die. For Venus is a thing not to be borne,
  if she rush on vehement. Who comes quietly indeed on the person who
  yields; but whom she finds haughty and of lofty notions, him taking (how
  thinkest thou?) she chastises. But Venus goes through air, and is on the
  ocean wave; and all things from her have their birth. She it is that sows
  and gives forth love, from whence all we on earth are engendered. As many
  indeed as ken the writings of the ancients, or are themselves ever among
  the muses, they know indeed, how that Jove was formerly inflamed with the
  love of Semele; they know too, how that formerly the lovely bright Aurora
  bore away Cephalus up to the Gods, for love, but still they live in
  heaven, and fly not from the presence of the Gods: but they acquiesce
  yielding, I ween, to what has befallen them. And wilt thou not bear it?
  Thy father then ought to have begotten thee on stipulated terms, or else
  under the dominion of other Gods, unless thou wilt be content with these
  laws. How many, thinkest thou, are in full and complete possession of
  their senses, who, when they see their bridal bed diseased, seem not to
  see it! And how many fathers, thinkest thou, have aided their erring sons
  in matters of love, for this is a maxim among the wise part of mankind,
  "that things that show not fair should be concealed." Nor should men
  labor too exactly their conduct in life, for neither would they do well
  to employ much accuracy in the roof wherewith their houses are covered;
  but having fallen into fortune so deep as thou hast, how dost thou
  imagine thou canst swim out? But if thou hast more things good than bad,
  mortal as thou art, thou surely must be well off. But cease, my dear
  child, from these evil thoughts, cease too from being haughty, for
  nothing else save haughtiness is this, to wish to be superior to the
  Gods. But, as thou art in love, endure it; a God hath willed it so: and,
  being ill, by some good means or other try to get rid of thy illness. But
  there are charms and soothing spells: there will appear some medicine for
  this sickness. Else surely men would be slow indeed in discoveries, if we
  women should not find contrivances.</p>

  <p>CHOR. Phædra, she speaks indeed most useful advice in thy present
  state: but thee I praise. Yet is this praise less welcome than her words,
  and to thee more painful to hear.</p>

  <p>PHÆ. This is it that destroys cities of men and families well
  governed&mdash;words too fair. For it is not at all requisite to speak
  words pleasant to the ear, but that whereby one may become of fair
  report.</p>

  <p>NUR. Why dost thou talk in this grand strain? thou needest not gay
  decorated words, but a man: as soon as possible must those be found, who
  will speak out the plain straightforward word concerning thee. For if thy
  life were not in calamities of such a cast, I never would have brought
  thee thus far for the sake of lust, and for thy pleasure: but now the
  great point is to save thy life; and this is not a thing deserving of
  blame.</p>

  <p>PHÆ. O thou that hast spoken dreadful things, wilt thou not shut thy
  mouth? and wilt not cease from uttering again those words most vile?</p>

  <p>NUR. Vile they are, but better these for thee than fair; but better
  will the deed be (if at least it will save thee), than the name, in the
  which while thou boastest, thou wilt die.</p>

  <p>PHÆ. Nay do not, I entreat thee by the Gods (for thou speakest well,
  but base are [the things thou speakest]) go beyond this, since rightly
  have I surrendered my life to love; but if thou speak base things in fair
  phrase, I shall be consumed, [being cast] into that [evil] which I am now
  avoiding.</p>

  <p>NUR. If in truth this be thy opinion, thou oughtest not to err, but if
  thou hast erred, be persuaded by me, for this is the next best thing thou
  canst do.<a name="Hipp_16"></a><a href="#HippN_16"><sup>[16]</sup></a> I
  have in the house soothing philters of love (and they but lately came
  into my thought); which, by no base deed, nor to the harm of thy senses,
  will rid you of this disease, unless you are obstinate. But it is
  requisite to receive from him that is the object of your love, some
  token, either some word, or some relic of his vest, and to join from two
  one love.</p>

  <p>PHÆ. But is the charm an unguent or a potion?</p>

  <p>NUR. I know not: wish to be relieved, not informed, my child.</p>

  <p>PHÆ. I fear thee, lest thou should appear too wise to me.</p>

  <p>NUR. Know that you would fear every thing, <i>if you fear this</i>,
  but what is it you are afraid of?</p>

  <p>PHÆ. Lest you should tell any of these things to the son of
  Theseus.</p>

  <p>NUR. Let be, my child, I will arrange these matters honorably, only be
  thou my coadjutor, O Venus, my revered mistress; but the other things
  which I purpose, it will suffice to tell to my friends within.</p>

<p class="center">CHORUS, PHÆDRA.</p>

  <p>CHOR. Love, love, O thou that instillest desire through the eyes,
  inspiring sweet affection in the souls of those against whom thou makest
  war, mayst thou never appear to me to my injury, nor come unmodulated:
  for neither is the blast of fire nor the bolt of heaven more vehement,
  than that of Venus, which Love, the boy of Jove, sends from his hands. In
  vain, in vain, both by the Alpheus, and at the Pythian temples of
  Ph&#339;bus does Greece then solemnize the slaughter of bulls: but Love,
  the tyrant of men, porter of the dearest chambers of Venus, we worship
  not, the destroyer and visitant of men in all shapes of calamity, when he
  comes. That virgin in &#338;chalia, yoked to no bridal bed, till then
  unwedded, and who knew no husband, having taken from her home a wanderer
  impelled by the oar, her, like some Bacchanal of Pluto, with blood, with
  smoke, and murderous hymeneals did Venus give to the son of Alcmena. O
  unhappy woman, because of her nuptials! O sacred wall of Thebes, O mouth
  of Dirce, you can assist me in telling, in what manner Venus comes: for
  by the forked lightning, by a cruel fate, did she put to eternal sleep
  the parent of the Jove-begotten Bacchus, when she was visited as a bride.
  For dreadful doth she breathe on all things, and like some bee hovers
  about.</p>

  <p>PHÆ. Women, be silent: I am undone.</p>

  <p>CHOR. What is there that affrights thee, Phædra, in thine house?</p>

  <p>PHÆ. Alas me! O! O! O! oh unhappy me, because of my sufferings!</p>

  <p>CHOR. What sound dost thou utter? what word speakest thou? tell me
  what report frightens thee, lady, rushing upon thy senses!</p>

  <p>PHÆ. We are undone. Do you, standing at these gates, hear what the
  noise is that strikes on the house?</p>

  <p>CHOR. Thou art by the gate, the noise that is sent forth from the
  house is thy care. But tell me, tell me, what evil, I pray thee, came
  <i>to thine ears</i>?</p>

  <p>PHÆ. The son of the warlike Amazon, Hippolytus, cries out, abusing in
  dreadful forms my attendant.</p>

  <p>CHOR. I hear indeed a noise, but can not plainly tell how it is. The
  voice came, it came through to the door.</p>

  <p>PHÆ. But hark! he calls her plainly the pander of wickedness, the
  betrayer of her master's bed.</p>

  <p>CHOR. Alas me for thy miseries! Thou art betrayed, dear mistress. What
  shall I counsel thee? for hidden things are come to light, and thou art
  utterly destroyed&mdash;&mdash;</p>

  <p>PHÆ. O! O!</p>

  <p>CHOR. Betrayed by thy friends.</p>

  <p>PHÆ. She hath destroyed me by speaking of my unhappy state, kindly but
  not honorably endeavoring to heal this disease.</p>

  <p>CHOR. How then? what wilt thou do, O thou that hast suffered things
  incurable?</p>

  <p>PHÆ. I know not, save one thing; to die as soon as possible is the
  only cure of my present sufferings.</p>

<p class="center">HIPPOLYTUS, PHÆDRA, NURSE, CHORUS.</p>

  <p>HIPP. O mother earth, and ye disclosing rays of the sun, of what words
  have I heard the dreadful sound!</p>

  <p>NUR. Be silent, my son, before any one hears thy voice.</p>

  <p>HIPP. It is not possible for me to be silent, when I have heard such
  dreadful things.</p>

  <p>NUR. Nay, I implore thee by thy beauteous hand.</p>

  <p>HIPP. Wilt not desist from bringing thy hand near me, and from
  touching my garments?</p>

  <p>NUR. O! by thy knees, I implore thee, do not utterly destroy me.</p>

  evil.</p>

  <p>HIPP. It is more fair to speak fair things to many.</p>

  <p>NUR. O my child, by no means dishonor your oath.</p>

  <p>NUR. O my son, what wilt thou do? wilt thou destroy thy friends?</p>

  <p>HIPP. <i>Friends!</i> I reject the word: no unjust person is my
  friend.</p>

  <p>NUR. Pardon, my child: that men should err is but to be expected.</p>

  <p>HIPP. O Jove, wherefore in the name of heaven didst thou place in the
  light of the sun that specious<a name="Hipp_18"></a><a
  href="#HippN_18"><sup>[18]</sup></a> evil to men, women? for if thou
  didst will to propagate the race of mortals, there was no necessity for
  this to be done by women, but men might, having placed an equivalent in
  thy temples, either in brass, or iron, or the weighty gold, buy a race of
  children, each for the consideration of the value paid, and thus might
  dwell in unmolested houses, without females. But now, first of all, when
  we prepare to bring this evil to our homes, we squander away the wealth
  of our houses. By this too it is evident, that woman is a great evil; for
  the father, who begat her and brought her up, having given her a dowry
  sends her away in order to be rid of the evil. But the husband, on the
  other hand, when he has received the baneful evil<a name="Hipp_19"></a><a
  href="#HippN_19"><sup>[19]</sup></a> into his house, rejoices, having
  added a beautiful decoration to a most vile image, and tricks her out
  with robes, unhappy man, while he has been insensibly minishing the
  wealth of the family. But he is constrained; so that having made alliance
  with noble kinsmen, he retains with [seeming] joy a marriage bitter to
  him: or if he has received a good bride, but worthless parents in law, he
  suppresses the evil that has befallen him by the consideration of the
  good. But his state is the easiest, whose wife is settled in his house, a
  cipher, but useless by reason of simplicity. But a wise woman I detest:
  may there not be in my house at least a woman more highly gifted with
  mind than woman ought to be. For Venus engenders mischief rather among
  clever women, but a woman who is not endowed with capacity, by reason of
  her small understanding, is removed from folly. But it is right that an
  attendant should have no access to a woman, but with them ought to dwell
  the speechless brute beasts, in which case they would be able neither to
  address any one, nor from them to receive a voice in return. But now,
  they that are evil follow after their evil devices within, and the
  servants carry it forth abroad. As thou also hast, O evil woman, come to
  the purpose of admitting me to share a bed which must not be
  approached&mdash;a father's. Which impious things I will wash out with
  flowing stream, pouring it into my ears: how then could I be the vile
  one, who do not even deem myself pure, because I have heard such
  things?&mdash;But be well assured, my piety protects thee, woman, for,
  had I not been taken unawares by the oaths of the Gods, never would I
  have refrained from telling these things to my father. But now will I
  depart from the house, <i>and stay</i> during the time that Theseus is
  absent from the land, and will keep my mouth silent; but I will see,
  returning with my father's return, how you will look at him, both you and
  your mistress. But your boldness I shall know, having before had proof of
  it. May you perish: but never shall I take my fill of hating women, not
  even if any one assert, that I am always saying this. For in some way or
  other they surely are always bad. Either then let some one teach them to
  be modest, or else let him suffer me ever to utter my invectives against
  them.</p>

  <p>PHÆ. O thou most vile, and the destruction of thy friends, what hast
  thou done to me! May Jove, my ancestor, tear thee up by the roots, having
  stricken thee by his fire. Did not I tell thee (did not I foresee thy
  intention?) to be silent with regard to those things with which I am now
  tormented? but thou couldst not refrain; wherefore I can no longer die
  with glory: but I must now in sooth employ new measures. For he, now that
  his mind is made keen with rage, will tell, to my detriment, thy errors
  to his father, and will fill the whole earth with the most vile reports.
  Mayst thou perish, both thou and whoever else is forward to assist
  friends against their will otherwise than by honorable means.</p>

  <p>NUR. Lady, thou canst indeed blame the evil I have wrought; for that
  which gnaws upon thee masters thy better judgment;&mdash;but I too have
  somewhat to say in answer to these things, if thou wilt admit it: I
  brought thee up, and have a kind affection toward thee; but, while
  searching for medicine for thy disease, I found not that I wished for.
  But if I had succeeded, I had been surely ranked among the wise; for we
  have the reputation of sense according to our success.</p>

  <p>PHÆ. What? is this conduct just, and satisfactory to me, to injure me
  first, and then to meet me in argument?</p>

  <p>NUR. We talk too long&mdash;I did not behave wisely. But even from
  this state of things it is possible that thou mayest be saved, my
  child.</p>

  <p>PHÆ. Desist from speaking; for before also thou didst not well advise
  for me, and didst attempt evil things. But depart from my sight, and take
  care about thyself; for I will settle my own affairs in an honorable
  manner. But you, noble daughters of Tr&#339;zene, grant thus much to me
  requesting it, bury in silence what you here have heard.</p>

  <p>CHOR. I swear by hallowed Dian, daughter of Jove, that I will never
  reveal to the face of day one of thy evils.</p>

  around me,<a name="Hipp_21"></a><a href="#HippN_21"><sup>[21]</sup></a>
  do I find for my present calamity, so that I may make the life of my
  children glorious, and may myself be assisted as things have now fallen
  out. For never will I disgrace the house of Crete at least, nor will I
  come before the face of Theseus having acted basely, for one's life's
  sake.</p>

  wretched virgins let fall into their father's billow the amber-beaming
  brightness of their tears: and that I could make my way to the shore

  mariners, dwelling in that dread bourn of heaven which Atlas doth
  sustain, and the ambrosial founts stream forth hard by the couches of
  Jove's palaces, where the divine and life-bestowing earth increases the

  Athens, when on the Munychian shore they bound the platted ends of their
  cables, and disembarked on the continent. Wherefore she was heartbroken

  hear all things, is found eager also in the case of ills. It is not
  indeed right, my father, to conceal thy misfortunes from friends, and
  even more than friends.</p>

  <p>THES. O men, who vainly go astray in many things, why then do ye teach
  ten thousand arts, and contrive and invent every thing; but one thing ye
  do not know, nor yet have investigated, to teach those to be wise who
  have no intellect!</p>

  <p>HIPP. A clever sophist this you speak of, who is able to compel those
  who have no wisdom to be rightly wise. But (for thou art arguing too
  refinedly on no suitable occasion) I fear, O father, lest thy tongue be
  talking at random through thy woes.</p>

  <p>THES. Alas! there ought to be established for men some infallible
  proof of their friends, and some means of knowing their dispositions,
  both who is true, and who is not a friend, and men ought all to have two
  voices, the one true, the other as it chanced, that the untrue one might
  be convicted by the true, and then we should not be deceived.</p>

  <p>HIPP. Has some one then falsely accused me in your ear, and am I
  suffering who am not at all guilty? I am amazed, for your words,
  wandering beyond the bounds of reason, do amaze me.</p>

  <p>THES. Alas! the mind of man, to what lengths will it go? what will be
  the limit to its boldness and temerity? For if it shall increase with
  each generation of man, and the successor shall be wicked a degree beyond
  his predecessor, it will be necessary for the Gods to add to the earth
  another land, which<a name="Hipp_34"></a><a
  href="#HippN_34"><sup>[34]</sup></a> will contain the unjust and the evil
  ones.&mdash;But look: ye on this man, who being born of me hath defiled
  my bed, and is manifestly convicted by the deceased of being most
  base.&mdash;But, since thou hast come to this attaint, show thy face here
  before thy father. Dost thou forsooth associate with the Gods, as being
  an extraordinary person? art thou chaste and uncontaminated with evil? I
  will not believe thy boasts, attributing (<i>as I must, if I do
  believe</i>) to the Gods the folly of thinking evil. Now then vaunt, and
  with thy feeding on inanimate food retail your doctrines upon men, and
  having Orpheus<a name="Hipp_35"></a><a
  href="#HippN_35"><sup>[35]</sup></a> for your master, revel it,
  reverencing the emptiness of many letters; <i>which avail you not</i>;
  since you are caught.</p>

  <p>But such sort of men I warn all to shun; for they hunt with
  fair-sounding words, while they devise base things. She is dead: dost
  thou think this will save thee? By this thou art most detected, O thou
  most vile one! For what sort of oaths, what arguments can be more strong
  than what she says, so that thou canst escape the accusation? Wilt thou
  say that she hated thee, and that the bastard race is hateful forsooth to
  those of noble birth? A bad housewife then of life you account her, if
  through hatred of thee she lost what was most dear to her. But wilt thou
  say that there is not this folly in men, but that there is in women? I
  myself have known young men who were not a whit more steady than women,
  when Venus disturbed the youthful mind: but their pretense of manliness
  protects them. Now however, why do I thus contend against thy words, when
  the corse, the surest witness, is here? Depart an exile from this land as
  soon as possible. And neither go to the divine-built Athens, nor to the
  confines of that land over which my sceptre rules. For if I thus
  suffering by thee be vanquished, never will the Isthmian Sinis bear
  witness of me that I killed him, but will say that I vainly boast. Nor
  will the Scironian rocks, that dwell by the sea, confess that I am
  formidable to the bad.</p>

  <p>CHOR. I know not how I can say that any of mortals is happy; for the
  things that were most excellent are turned back again.</p>

  <p>HIPP. Father, thy rage indeed, and the commotion of thy mind is
  terrible; this thing, however, though it have fair arguments, if any one
  unravel it, is not fair. But I am unadorned with phrase to speak to the
  multitude, but to speak to my equals and to a few, more expert: but this
  also has consistency in it; for those, who are of no account among the
  wise, are more fitted to speak before the rabble. But yet it is necessary
  for me, since this calamity has come, to unloose my tongue. But first
  will I begin to speak from that point where first you attacked, as though
  you would destroy, and as though I should not answer again. Dost thou
  behold this light and this earth? In these there is not a man more chaste
  than me, not even though thou deny it. For, first indeed, I know to
  reverence the Gods, and to have such friends as attempt not to be unjust,
  but those, to whom there is modesty, so that neither they give utterance
  to evil thoughts, nor minister in return base services to those who use
  their friendship: nor am I the derider of my associates, O father, but
  the same man to my friends when they are not present, and when I am with
  them. But of one thing by which thou thinkest to crush me, I am pure;<a
  name="Hipp_36"></a><a href="#HippN_36"><sup>[36]</sup></a> for to this
  day my body is undefiled by the couch of love; and I know not the deed
  except hearing of it by report, and seeing it in a picture, nor even am I
  forward to look at these things, having a virgin mind. And perhaps my
  modesty persuades you not. Behooves it thee then to show in what manner I
  lost it. Did this woman's person excel in beauty all women? Or did I hope
  to rule over thine house, having thy bridal bed as carrying dowry with
  it? I must in that case have been a fool, and not at all in my senses.
  But did I do it as though to reign were pleasant to the modest? By no
  means indeed is it, except monarchy have destroyed the minds of men who
  are pleased with her. But I would wish indeed to be first victor in the
  Grecian games, but second in the state ever to be happy with the most
  excellent friends. For thus is it possible to be well circumstanced: but
  the absence of the danger gives greater joy than dominion. One of my
  arguments has not been spoken, but the rest you are in possession of:
  for, if I had a witness such as myself am, and were she alive during my
  contention, you would know the evil ones, searching them by their works.
  But now I swear by Jove, the guardian of oaths,<a name="Hipp_37"></a><a
  href="#HippN_37"><sup>[37]</sup></a> and by the plain of the earth, that
  never touched I thy bridal bed, nor ever wished it, nor conceived the
  thought. Else may I perish inglorious, without a name, and may neither
  sea nor earth receive the flesh of me when dead, if I be a wicked man.
  But whether or no she have destroyed her life through fear, I know not:
  for it is not lawful for me to speak further. Cautious<a
  name="Hipp_38"></a><a href="#HippN_38"><sup>[38]</sup></a> she was,
  though she could not be chaste; but I, who could be, had the power to no
  good purpose.</p>

  <p>CHOR. Thou hast said sufficient to rebut the charge, in offering the
  oaths by the Gods, no slight proof.</p>

  <p>THES. Is not this man then an enchanter and a juggler, who trusts that
  he will overcome my mind by his goodness of disposition, after he has
  dishonored his father?</p>

  <p>HIPP. I too very much wonder at this conduct of yours, my father; for
  if you were my son, and I your father, I should slay you, and not punish
  you by banishment, if you had dared to defile my wife.</p>

  <p>THES. How fitly hast thou said this! yet thou shalt not so die, as
  thou hast laid down this law for thyself; for a quick grave is easiest to
  the miserable man; but wandering an exile from thy country's land to
  foreign realms, thou shalt drag out a life of bitterness; for this is the
  reward for the impious man.</p>

  <p>HIPP. Ah me! what wilt thou do? wilt thou not even await time as
  evidence against me, but wilt thou banish me from the land?</p>

  <p>THES. Ay, beyond the ocean, and the place of Atlas,<a
  name="Hipp_39"></a><a href="#HippN_39"><sup>[39]</sup></a> if any way I
  could, so much do I hate thee.</p>

  <p>HIPP. Without having even examined oath, or proof, or the sayings of
  the seers, wilt thou cast me uncondemned from out the land?</p>

  <p>THES. This letter here, that waiteth no seer's observations,<a
  name="Hipp_40"></a><a href="#HippN_40"><sup>[40]</sup></a> accuses thee
  faithfully; but to the birds that flit above my head I bid a long
  farewell.</p>

  <p>HIPP. O Gods, wherefore then do I not ope my mouth, who am destroyed
  by you whom I worship?&mdash;And yet not so&mdash;for thus I should not
  altogether persuade those whom I ought, but should be violating to no
  purpose the oaths which I have sworn.</p>

  <p>THES. Alas me! how thy sanctity kills me! Wilt not thou go as quick as
  possible from thy country's land?</p>

  <p>HIPP. Whither then shall I unhappy turn me; what stranger's mansion
  shall I enter, banished on this charge?</p>

  <p>THES. His, who delights to entertain defilers of women, and those who
  dwell with<a name="Hipp_41"></a><a href="#HippN_41"><sup>[41]</sup></a>
  evil deeds.</p>

  <p>HIPP. Alas! alas! this goes to my heart, and almost makes me weep: if
  indeed I appear vile, and seem so to thee.</p>

  <p>THES. Then oughtest thou to have groaned, and owned the guilt before,
  when thou daredst to wrong thy father's wife.</p>

  <p>HIPP. O mansions, would that ye could utter me a voice, and bear
  witness whether I be a vile man!</p>

  <p>THES. Dost fly to dumb witnesses? this deed, though it speak not,
  clearly proves thee vile.</p>

  <p>HIPP. Alas! would that I could look upon myself standing opposite, to
  that degree do I weep for the evils which I suffer!</p>

  <p>THES. Thou hast accustomed thyself much more to regard thyself, than
  to be a just man, and to do what is righteous to thy parents.</p>

  <p>HIPP. O unhappy mother! O wretched natal hour! may none of my friends
  ever be illegitimate.</p>

  <p>THES. Servants, will ye not drag him out? did you not hear me long ago
  pronounce him banished!</p>

  <p>HIPP. Any one of them shall touch me to his cost however; but thou
  thyself, if it be thy desire, thrust me out from the land.</p>

  <p>THES. I will do this, unless thou wilt obey my words, for no pity for
  thy banishment comes over me.</p>

  <p>HIPP. It is fixed, as it seems; alas, wretch that I am! since I know
  these things indeed, but know not how to say them. O most dear to me of
  deities, daughter of Latona, thou that assortest with me, huntest with
  me, we shall then indeed be banished illustrious Athens: but farewell O
  city, and land of Erectheus. O plain of Tr&#339;zene, how many things
  hast thou to employ the happy youth! Farewell! for I address thee,
  beholding thee for the last time&mdash;Come youths of this land my
  companions, bid me farewell, and conduct me from the land, for never
  shall you see a man more chaste, even though I seem not to my father.</p>

<p class="center">CHORUS.</p>

  <p>Surely the providence of the Gods, when it comes into my mind, greatly
  takes away sorrow: but cherishing in my hope some knowledge, I am utterly
  deficient, when I look on the fortunes and on the deeds of men, for they
  are changed in different manners, and the life of man varies, ever
  exceeding vague. Would that in answer to my petitions fate from the Gods
  would give me this, prosperity with riches, and a mind unsullied by
  griefs. And be my character neither too high, nor on the other hand
  infamous. But changing my easy habits with the morrow ever may I lead a
  happy life; for no longer have I an unperturbed mind, but I see things
  contrary to my expectations: since we have seen the brightest star of
  Grecian Minerva sent forth to another land on account of his father's
  rage. O sands of the neighboring shore, and mountain wood, where with the
  swift-footed dogs he wont to slay the wild beasts, accompanying the
  chaste Dian! No more shalt thou mount the car drawn by the team of
  Henetian steeds, restraining with thy foot the horses in their exercise
  on the course round Limna.<a name="Hipp_42"></a><a
  href="#HippN_42"><sup>[42]</sup></a> And the sleepless song that used to
  dwell under the bridge of the chords shall cease in thy father's house.
  And the haunts of the daughter of Latona in the deep wood shall be
  without their garlands: and the contest among the damsels for thy bridal
  bed has died away by reason of thy exile. But I, for thy misfortunes,
  shall endure with tears a fortuneless fortune.<a name="Hipp_43"></a><a
  href="#HippN_43"><sup>[43]</sup></a> O unhappy mother, thou hast brought
  forth in vain! Alas! I am enraged with the Gods. Alas! alas! united
  charms of marriage, wherefore send ye the unhappy one, guilty of no
  crime, away from his country's land&mdash;away from these mansions?</p>

  <p>But lo! I perceive a follower of Hippolytus with a sad countenance
  coming toward the house in haste.</p>

<p class="center">MESSENGER, CHORUS.</p>

  <p>MESS. Ye females, whither going can I find Theseus, king of this land?
  If ye know, tell me: is he within this palace?</p>

  <p>CHOR. The [king] himself is coming out of the palace.</p>

<p class="center">MESSENGER, THESEUS, CHORUS.</p>

  <p>MESS. I bring a tale that demands concern, of thee and of thy
  subjects, both those who inhabit the city of the Athenians, and the
  realms of the Tr&#339;zenian land.</p>

  <p>THES. What is it? Has any sudden calamity come upon the two
  neighboring states?</p>

  <p>MESS. To speak the word&mdash;Hippolytus is no more. He views the
  light however for a short moment.</p>

  <p>THES. <i>Killed</i>? By whom? Has any come to enmity with him, whose
  wife, as his father's, he has forcibly defiled?</p>

  <p>MESS. His own chariot slew him, and the imprecations of thy mouth,
  which thou didst put up to thy father, the ruler of the ocean, concerning
  thy son.</p>

  <p>THES. O ye Gods! and O Neptune! how truly then wert thou my father,
  when thou didst duly hear my imprecations! Tell me too, how did he
  perish? in what way did the staff of Justice strike him that disgraced
  me?</p>

  <p>MESS. We indeed near the wave-beaten shore were combing out with combs
  the horses' hair, weeping, for there had come a messenger saying, that
  Hippolytus no longer trod on this land, having from thee received the
  sentence of wretched banishment. But he came bringing to us on the shore
  the same strain of tears: and an innumerable throng of his friends and
  companions came following with him. But at length after some time he
  spake, having ceased from his groans. "Wherefore am I thus disquieted? My
  father's words must be obeyed. My servants, yoke to my car the harnessed
  steeds, for this city is for me no more." Then indeed every man hasted,
  and sooner than one could speak we drew up the horses caparisoned before
  our master; and he seizes with his hands the reins from off the bow of
  the chariot, mounting with his foot sandaled as it was.<a
  name="Hipp_44"></a><a href="#HippN_44"><sup>[44]</sup></a> And first
  indeed he addressed the Gods with outstretched hands: "Jove, may I no
  longer exist, if I am a base man; but may my father perceive how
  unworthily he treats me, either when I am dead, or while I view the
  light." And on this having taken the whip in his hands he struck the
  horses both at once: and we the attendants followed our master by the
  chariot close to the reins, along the road that leads straightway to
  Argos and Epidauria, but when we came into the desert country, there is a
  certain shore beyond this land which slopes even down to the Saronic Sea,
  from thence a voice like the subterraneous thunder of Jove sent forth a
  dreadful groan appalling to hear, and the horses pointed their heads
  erect and their ears toward the sky, and on us there came a vehement
  fear, whence possibly the voice could come: but looking toward the
  sea-beaten shore we beheld a vast wave pillared in heaven, so that the
  view of the heights of Sciron was taken from mine eye:<a
  name="Hipp_45"></a><a href="#HippN_45"><sup>[45]</sup></a> and it
  concealed the Isthmus and the rock of Æsculapius. And then swelling up
  and splashing forth<a name="Hipp_46"></a><a
  href="#HippN_46"><sup>[46]</sup></a> much foam around in the ocean surf,
  it moves toward the shore, where was the chariot drawn by its four
  horses. But together with its breaker and its tripled surge,<a
  name="Hipp_47"></a><a href="#HippN_47"><sup>[47]</sup></a> the wave sent
  forth a bull, a fierce monster; with whose bellowing the whole land
  filled resounded fearfully: and to the lookers-on a sight appeared more
  dreadful than the eyes could bear. And straightway a dreadful fear comes
  over the steeds. But their master, being much conversant with the ways of
  horses, seized the reins in his hands, and pulls them as a sailor pulls
  his oar, having fixed his body in an opposite direction to the reins.<a
  name="Hipp_48"></a><a href="#HippN_48"><sup>[48]</sup></a> But they,
  champing with their jaws the forged bits, bare him on forcibly, heeding
  neither the hand that steered them, nor the traces, nor the compact
  chariot: and, if indeed holding the reins he directed their course toward
  the softer ground, the bull appeared in front, so as to turn them away
  maddening with fright the four horses that drew the chariot. But if they
  were borne to the rocks maddened in mettle, silently approaching the
  chariot he followed so far, until he overthrew it and drove it backward,
  dashing the felly of the wheel against the rock. And all was in
  confusion, and the naves of the wheels flew up, and the linch-pins of the
  axles. But the unhappy man himself entangled in the reins is dragged
  along, bound in a difficult bond, his head dashed against the rocks, and
  torn his flesh, and crying out in a voice dreadful to hear, "Stop, O ye
  that have been trained up in my stalls, do not destroy me. Oh unhappy
  imprecation of my father! Who will come near and save a most excellent
  man?" But many of us wishing so to do failed through want of swiftness:
  and he indeed freed, in what manner I know not, from the entanglements of
  the reins, falls, having the breath of life in him, but for a very short
  time. And the horses vanished, and the woeful monster of the bull I know
  not where in the mountain country. I am indeed the slave of thy house, O
  king, but thus much never shall I at least be able to be persuaded of thy
  son, that he is evil, not even if the whole race of women were hung, and
  though one should fill with writing all the fir of Ida,<a
  name="Hipp_49"></a><a href="#HippN_49"><sup>[49]</sup></a> since I am
  confident that he is virtuous.</p>

  <p>CHOR. Alas! alas! The calamity of new evils is consummated, nor is
  there refuge from fate and from what must be.</p>

  <p>THES. Through hate of the man, who has thus suffered, I was pleased
  with this account; but now, having respect unto the Gods, and to him,
  because he is of me, I am neither pleased, nor yet troubled at these
  ills.</p>

  <p>MESS. How then? Must we bring him hither, or what must we do to the
  unhappy man to gratify thy wishes! Think; but if thou take my advice,
  thou wilt not be harsh toward thy son in his misfortunes.</p>

  <p>THES. Bear him hither, that seeing him before my eyes that denied he
  had defiled my bed, I may confute him with words, and with what has
  happened from the Gods.</p>

  <p>CHOR. Thou, Venus, bendest the stubborn mind of the Gods, and of
  mortals, and with thee he of varied plume, that darts about on swiftest
  wing; and flies over the earth and over the loud-resounding briny ocean;
  and Love charms to subjection, on whose maddened heart the winged urchin
  come gleaming with gold, the race of the mountain whelps, and of those
  that inhabit the sea, and as many things as the earth nourisheth, which
  the sun doth behold scorched [with its rays,] and men: but over all these
  things thou, Venus, alone holdest sovereign rule.</p>

<p class="center">DIANA, THESEUS, CHORUS.</p>

  <p>DI. Thee, the noble son of Ægeus, I command to listen; but it is I,
  Diana, daughter of Latona, who am addressing thee: Theseus, wherefore
  dost thou, wretched man, take delight in these things, seeing that thou
  hast slain in no just way thy son, being persuaded by the lying words of
  thy wife in things not seen? But the guilt that has seized on thee is
  manifest. How canst thou, shamed as thou art, refrain from hiding thy
  body beneath the dark recesses of the earth? or from withdrawing thy foot
  from this suffering, by changing thy nature, and becoming a winged
  creature above? Since among good men at least thou hast not a part in
  life to possess. Hear, O Theseus, the state of thy ills. Even though I
  gain no advantage from it, yet will I torment thee; but for this purpose
  came I to show thee the upright mind of thy son, that he may die with a
  good reputation, and thy wife's passion, or, in some sort, nobleness;
  for, gnawed by the stings of that deity most hateful to us, as many as
  delight in virginity, she became enamored of thy son. But while she
  endeavored by right feeling to conquer Venus, she was destroyed not
  willingly by the means employed by the nurse, who having first bound him
  by oaths, told thy son her malady. But he, as was right, obeyed not her
  words; nor, again, though evil-entreated by thee, did he violate the
  sanctity of his oaths, being a pious man. But she, fearing lest her
  conduct should be scrutinized, wrote a false letter, and by deceit
  destroyed thy son, but nevertheless persuaded thee.</p>

  <p>THES. Ah me!</p>

  <p>DI. My tale torments thee, Theseus, but be still, that having heard
  what follows thou mayest groan the more&mdash;Knowest thou then that thou
  receivedst from thy father three wishes with a certainty of their being
  granted? Whereof one thou hast expended, O most evil one, on thy son,
  when thou mightest have done it on some of thine enemies. Thy father then
  that dwelleth in the ocean, gave thee as much as he was bound to give,
  because he promised. But thou both in his eyes and in mine appearest
  evil, who neither didst await nor examine proof, nor the voice of the
  prophets, didst not leave the consideration to length of time, but,
  quicker than became thee, didst vent thy curses against thy son and slay
  him.</p>

  <p>THES. Mistress, let me die!</p>

  <p>DI. Thou hast committed dreadful deeds, but nevertheless, it is still
  possible even for thee to obtain pardon for these things. For Venus
  willed that these things should be in order to satiate her rage. But
  among the Gods the law is thus&mdash;None wishes to thwart the purpose of
  him that wills anything, but we always give way. Since, be well assured,
  were it not that I feared Jove, never should I have come to such
  disgrace, as to suffer to die a man of all mortals the most dear to me.
  But thine error, first of all thine ignorance frees from malice; and then
  thy wife by her dying put an end to the proof of words, so as to persuade
  thy mind. Chiefly then on thee these ills are burst, but sorrow is to me
  too; for Gods rejoice not when the pious die; the wicked however we
  destroy with their children and their houses.</p>

  <p>CHOR. And lo! the unhappy man there is coming, all mangled his young
  flesh and auburn head. Oh the misery of the house! such double anguish
  coming down from heaven has been wrought in the palaces!</p>

<p class="center">HIPPOLYTUS, DIANA, THESEUS, CHORUS.</p>

  rush through my head, and the spasm darts across my brain. Stop, I will
  rest my fainting body. Oh! oh! O those hateful horses of my chariot,
  things which I fed with my own hand, ye have destroyed me utterly and
  slain me. Oh! oh! by the Gods, gently, my servants, touch with your hands
  my torn flesh. Who stands by my side on the right? Lift me up properly,
  and take hold all equally on me, the unblessed of heaven, and cursed by
  my father's error&mdash;Jove, Jove, beholdest thou these things? Lo! I,
  the chaste, and the reverencer of the Gods, I who in modesty exceed all,
  have lost my life, and go to a manifest hell beneath the earth; but in
  vain have I labored in the task of piety toward men. O! O! O! O! and now
  the pain, the pain comes upon me, loose unhappy me, and let death come to
  be my physician. Destroy me, destroy the unhappy one&mdash;I long for a

  eternal rest. Oh unhappy curse of my father! the evil too of my

  <p>HIPP. I mourn therefore also my father's misery.</p>

  <p>DI. He was deceived by the devices of the Goddess.</p>

  <p>HIPP. Oh! unhappy thou, because of this calamity, my father!</p>

  <p>THES. I perish, my son, nor have I delight in life.</p>

  <p>HIPP. I lament thee rather than myself on account of thy error.</p>

  <p>THES. My son, would that I could die in thy stead!</p>

  <p>HIPP. Oh! the bitter gifts of thy father Neptune!</p>

  <p>THES. Would that the prayer had never come into my mouth.</p>

  <p>HIPP. Wherefore this wish? thou wouldst have slain me, so enraged wert
  thou then.</p>

  <p>THES. For I was deceived in my notions by the Gods.</p>

  <p>HIPP. Alas! would that the race of mortals could curse the Gods!</p>

  <p>DI. Let be; for not even when thou art under the darkness of the earth
  shall the rage arising from the bent of the Goddess Venus descend upon
  thy body unrevenged: by reason of thy piety and thy excellent mind. For
  with these inevitable weapons from mine own hand will I revenge me on
  another,<a name="Hipp_52"></a><a href="#HippN_52"><sup>[52]</sup></a>
  whoever to her be the dearest of mortals. But to thee, O unhappy one, in
  recompense for these evils, will I give the greatest honors in the land
  of Tr&#339;zene; for the unwedded virgins before their nuptials shall
  shear their locks to thee for many an age, owning the greatest sorrow
  tears can give; but ever among the virgins shall there be a remembrance
  of thee that shall awake the song, nor dying away without a name shall
  Phædra's love toward thee pass unrecorded:&mdash;But thou, O son of the
  aged Ægeus, take thy son in thine arms and clasp him to thee; for
  unwillingly thou didst destroy him, but that men should err, when the
  Gods dispose events, is but to be expected!&mdash;and thee, Hippolytus, I
  exhort not to remain at enmity with thy father; for thou perceivest the
  fate, whereby thou wert destroyed. And farewell! for it is not lawful for
  me to behold the dead, nor to pollute mine eye with the gasps of the
  dying; but I see that thou art now near this calamity.</p>

  <p>HIPP. Go thou too, and farewell, blessed virgin! But thou easily
  quittest a long companionship. But I give up all enmity against my father
  at thy request, for before also I was wont to obey thy words. Ah! ah!
  darkness now covers me over mine eyes. Take hold on me, my father, and
  lift up my body.</p>

  <p>THES. Ah me! my son, what dost thou, do to me unhappy?</p>

  <p>HIPP. I perish, and do indeed see the gates of hell.</p>

  <p>THES. What? leaving my mind uncleansed from thy blood?</p>

  <p>HIPP. No in sooth, since I free thee from this murder.</p>

  <p>THES. What sayest thou? dost thou remit me free from the guilt of
  blood?</p>

  <p>HIPP. I call to witness Dian that slays with the bow.</p>

  <p>THES. O most dear, how noble thou appearest to thy father!</p>

  <p>HIPP. O farewell thou too, take my best farewell, my father!</p>

  <p>THES. Oh me! for thy pious and brave soul!</p>

  <p>HIPP. Pray to have legitimate sons like me.</p>

  <p>THES. Do not, I prithee, leave me, my son, but be strong.</p>

  <p>HIPP. My time of strength is past; for I perish, my father: but cover
  my face as quickly as possible with robes.</p>

  <p>THES. O famous realms of Athens and of Pallas, of what a man will ye
  have been bereaved! Oh unhappy I! What abundant reason, Venus, shall I
  have to remember thy ills!</p>

  <p>CHOR. This common grief to all the citizens hath come unexpectedly.
  There will be a fast falling of many tears; for the mournful stories of
  great men rather obtain.</p>

<h3>NOTES ON HIPPOLYTUS</h3>

<hr class="short" />

<div class="note">
  <p><a name="HippN_1"></a><a href="#Hipp_1">[1]</a> The construction in
  the original furnishes a remarkable example of the "nominativus
  pendens."</p>

  <p><a name="HippN_2"></a><a href="#Hipp_2">[2]</a> Or, <i>that posterity
  might know it</i>. TR. Dindorf would omit these words. B.</p>

  <p><a name="HippN_3"></a><a href="#Hipp_3">[3]</a> Dindorf would omit
  these lines. I think the difficulty in the structure may be removed by
  reading <span lang="el"
  title="hostis">&#x201B;&#x3BF;&#x3C3;&#x3C4;&#x3B9;&#x3C2;</span> instead
  of <span lang="el"
  title="hosois">&#x201B;&#x3BF;&#x3C3;&#x3BF;&#x3B9;&#x3C2;</span>. The
  enallage, <span lang="el" title="hostis ...
  toutois">&#x201B;&#x3BF;&#x3C3;&#x3C4;&#x3B9;&#x3C2; ...
  &#x3C4;&#x3BF;&#x3C5;&#x3C4;&#x3BF;&#x3B9;&#x3C2;</span>, is by no means
  unusual. B.</p>

  with <span lang="el"
  title="petra">&#x3C0;&#x3B5;&#x3C4;&#x3C1;&#x3B1;</span>, as in the
  translation, but other commentators prefer, which is certainly more
  simple, to join it with <span lang="el"
  title="hydôr">&#x201B;&#x3C5;&#x3B4;&#x3C9;&#x3C1;</span>. Then the
  difficulty occurs of sea-water being unfit for washing vests. This
  difficulty Beck obviates, by saying that <span lang="el" title="hydôr
  ôkeanou">&#x201B;&#x3C5;&#x3B4;&#x3C9;&#x3C1;
  &#x3C9;&#x3BA;&#x3B5;&#x3B1;&#x3BD;&#x3BF;&#x3C5;</span> may be applied
  to fresh water, Ocean being the parent of all streams, the word <span
  lang="el"
  title="ôkeanou">&#x3C9;&#x3BA;&#x3B5;&#x3B1;&#x3BD;&#x3BF;&#x3C5;</span>
  being here, in a manner, redundant. TR. Matthiæ is very wrath with the
  "all on a washing day" manner in which the Chorus learned Phædra's
  indisposition. The "Bothie of Toper na Fuosich" will furnish some similar
  simplicities, such as the meeting a lassie "digging potatoes." But we
  might as well object to the whole story of Nausicaa. It must be
  recollected that the duties of the laundry were considered more
  aristocratic by the ancients, than in modern times. B.</p>

  quoque occidero." He compares Alcest. 389. B.</p>

  <p><a name="HippN_11"></a><a href="#Hipp_11">[11]</a> See Matthiæ's note.

  <i>Phædra was chaste (in your eyes), who had not the power of being

<h3>THE ARGUMENT.</h3>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Apollo desired of the Fates that Admetus, who was about to die, might
  give a substitute to die for him, that so he might live for a term equal
  to his former life; and Alcestis, his wife, gave herself up, while
  neither of his parents were willing to die instead of their son. But not
  long after the time when this calamity happened, Hercules having arrived,
  and having learned from a servant what had befallen Alcestis, went to her
  tomb, and having made Death retire, covers the lady with a robe; and
  requested Admetus to receive her and keep her for him; and said he had
  borne her off as a prize in wrestling; but when he would not, he unveiled
  her, and discovered her whom he was lamenting.</p>

  <p>O mansions of Admetus, wherein I endured to acquiesce in the slave's
  table,<a name="Alc_1"></a><a href="#AlcN_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> though a
  God; for Jove was the cause, by slaying my son Æsculapius, hurling the
  lightning against his breast: whereat enraged, I slay the Cyclops,
  forgers of Jove's fire; and me my father compelled to serve for hire with
  a mortal, as a punishment for these things. But having come to this land,
  I tended the herds of him who received me, and have preserved this house
  until this day: for being pious I met with a pious man,<a
  name="Alc_2"></a><a href="#AlcN_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> the son of Pheres,
  whom I delivered from dying by deluding the Fates: but those Goddesses
  granted me that Admetus should escape the impending death, could he
  furnish in his place another dead for the powers below. But having tried
  and gone through all his friends, his father and his aged mother who bore
  him, he found not, save his wife, one who was willing to die for him, and
  view no more the light: who now within the house is borne in their hands,
  breathing her last; for on this day is it destined for her to die, and to
  depart from life. But I, lest the pollution<a name="Alc_3"></a><a
  href="#AlcN_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> come upon me in the house, leave this
  palace's most dear abode. But already I behold Death near, priest of the
  dead, who is about to bear her down to the mansions of Pluto; but he
  comes at the right time, observing this day, in the which it was destined
  for her to die.</p>

  <p>DEA. Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! What dost thou at the palace? why tamest here,
  Ph&#339;bus? Art thou again at thy deeds of injustice, taking away and
  putting an end to the honors of the powers beneath? Did it not suffice
  thee to stay the death of Admetus, when thou didst delude the Fates by
  fraudful artifice?<a name="Alc_5"></a><a
  href="#AlcN_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> But now too dost thou keep guard for
  her, having armed thine hand with thy bow, who then promised, in order to
  redeem her husband, herself, the daughter of Pelias, to die for him?</p>

  <p>AP. Fear not, I cleave to justice and honest arguments.</p>

  <p>DEA. What business then has your bow, if you cleave to justice?</p>

  <p>AP. It is my habit ever to bear it.</p>

  <p>DEA. Yes, and without regard to justice to aid this house.</p>

  <p>AP. <i>Ay</i>, for I am afflicted at the misfortunes of a man that is
  dear to me.</p>

  <p>DEA. And wilt thou deprive me of this second dead?</p>

  <p>AP. But neither took I him from thee by force.</p>

  <p>DEA. How then is he upon earth, and not beneath the ground?</p>

  <p>AP. Because he gave in his stead his wife, after whom thou art now
  come.</p>

  <p>DEA. Yes, and will bear her off to the land beneath.</p>

  <p>AP. Take her away, for I know not whether I can persuade thee.</p>

  <p>DEA. What? to slay him, whom I ought? for this was I commanded.</p>

  <p>AP. No: but to cast death upon those about to die.</p>

  <p>DEA. Yes, I perceive thy speech, and what thou aim'st at.</p>

  <p>AP. Is it possible then for Alcestis to arrive at old age?</p>

  <p>DEA. It is not: consider that I too am delighted with my due
  honors.</p>

  <p>AP. Thou canst not, however, take more than one life.</p>

  <p>DEA. When the young die I earn the greater glory.</p>

  <p>AP. And if she die old, she will be sumptuously entombed.<a

  <p>DEA. Those who have means would purchase to die old.</p>

  <p>AP. Doth it not then seem good to thee to grant me this favor?</p>

  <p>DEA. No in truth; and thou knowest my ways.</p>

  <p>AP. Yes, hostile to mortals, and detested by the Gods.</p>

  <p>DEA. Thou canst not have all things, which thou oughtest not.</p>

  <p>AP. Nevertheless, thou wilt stop, though thou art over-fierce; such a
  man will come to the house of Pheres, whom Eurystheus hath sent after the
  chariot and its horses,<a name="Alc_7"></a><a
  href="#AlcN_7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> <i>to bring them</i> from the wintry
  regions of Thrace, who in sooth, being welcomed in the mansions of
  Admetus, shall take away by force this woman from thee; and there will be
  no obligation to thee at my hands, but still thou wilt do this, and wilt
  be hated by me.</p>

  <p>DEA. Much though thou talkest, thou wilt gain nothing. This woman then
  shall descend to the house of Pluto; and I am advancing upon her, that I
  may begin the rites on her with my sword; for sacred is he to the Gods
  beneath the earth, the hair of whose head this sword hath consecrated.<a
  name="Alc_8"></a><a href="#AlcN_8"><sup>[8]</sup></a></p>

<p class="center">CHORUS.</p>

  <p>SEMICH. Wherefore in heaven's name is this stillness before the
  palace? why is the house of Admetus hushed in silence?</p>

  <p>SEMICH. But there is not even one of our friends near, who can tell us
  whether we have to deplore the departed queen, or whether Alcestis,
  daughter of Pelias, yet living views this light, who has appeared to me
  and to all to have been the best wife toward her husband.</p>

  <p>CHOR. Hears any one either a wailing, or the beating of hands within
  the house, or a lamentation, as though the thing had taken place?<a
  name="Alc_9"></a><a href="#AlcN_9"><sup>[9]</sup></a> There is not
  however any one of the servants standing before the gates. Oh would that
  thou wouldst appear, O Apollo, amidst the waves of this calamity!</p>

  <p>SEMICH. They would not however be silent, were she dead.</p>

  <p>SEMICH. For the corse is certainly not gone from the house.</p>

  <p>SEMICH. Whence this conjecture? I do not presume this. What is it
  gives you confidence?</p>

  <p>SEMICH. How could Admetus have made a private funeral of his so
  excellent wife?</p>

  <p>CHOR. But before the gates I see not the bath of water from the
  fountain,<a name="Alc_10"></a><a href="#AlcN_10"><sup>[10]</sup></a> as
  is the custom at the gates of the dead: and in the vestibule is no shorn
  hair, which is wont to fall in grief for the dead; the youthful<a
  name="Alc_11"></a><a href="#AlcN_11"><sup>[11]</sup></a> hand of women
  for the youthful <i>wife</i> sound not.</p>

  <p>SEMICH. And yet this is the appointed day,&mdash;</p>

  <p>SEMICH. What is this thou sayest?</p>

  <p>SEMICH. In the which she must go beneath the earth.</p>

  <p>SEMICH. Thou hast touched my soul, hast touched my heart.</p>

  <p>SEMICH. When the good are afflicted, he must mourn, who from the
  beginning has been accounted good.</p>

  <p>CHOR. But there is not whither in the earth any one having sent naval
  equipment, or to Lycia, or to the thirsty site of Hammon's temple, can
  redeem the unhappy woman's life, for abrupt fate approaches, and I know
  not to whom of those that sacrifice at the hearths of the Gods I can go.
  But only if the son of Ph&#339;bus were viewing with his eyes this light,
  could she come, having left the darksome habitations and the gates of
  Pluto: for he raised up the dead, before that the stroke of the
  lightning's fire hurled by Jove destroyed him. But now what hope of life
  can I any longer entertain? For all things have already been done by the
  king, and at the altars of all the Gods abound the victims dropping with
  blood, and no cure is there of these evils.</p>

<p class="center">CHORUS, FEMALE ATTENDANT.</p>

  <p>CHOR. But here comes one of the female attendants from the house, in
  tears; what shall I hear has happened? To mourn indeed, if any thing
  happens to our lords, is pardonable: but whether the lady be still alive,
  or whether she be dead, we would wish to know.</p>

  <p>ATT. You may call her both alive and dead.</p>

  <p>CHOR. And how can the same woman be both alive and dead?</p>

  <p>ATT. Already she is on the verge of death,<a name="Alc_12"></a><a
  href="#AlcN_12"><sup>[12]</sup></a> and breathing her life away.</p>

  <p>CHOR. Oh wretched man, being what thyself of what a wife art thou
  bereft!</p>

  <p>ATT. My master knows not this yet, until he suffer.</p>

  <p>CHOR. Is there no longer hope that she may save her life?</p>

  <p>ATT. No, for the destined day makes its attack upon her.</p>

  <p>CHOR. Are not then suitable preparations made for these events?</p>

  <p>ATT. Yes, the adornments<a name="Alc_13"></a><a
  href="#AlcN_13"><sup>[13]</sup></a> are ready, wherewith her husband will
  bury her.</p>

  <p>CHOR. Let her know then that she will die glorious, and by far the
  best of women under the sun.</p>

  <p>ATT. And how not the best? who will contest it? What must the woman
  be, who has surpassed her? and how can any give greater proof of
  esteeming her husband, than by being willing to die for him? And these
  things indeed the whole city knoweth. But what she did in the house you
  will marvel when you hear. For, when she perceived that the destined day
  was come, she washed her fair skin with water from the river; and having
  taken from her closets of cedar vesture and ornaments, she attired
  herself becomingly; and standing before the altar she prayed: "O
  mistress, since I go beneath the earth, adoring thee for the last time, I
  will beseech thee to protect my orphan children, and to the one join a
  loving wife, and to the other a noble husband: nor, as their mother
  perishes, let my children untimely die, but happy in their paternal
  country let them complete a joyous life."&mdash;But all the altars, which
  are in the house of Admetus, she went to, and crowned, and prayed,
  tearing the leaves from off the myrtle boughs, tearless, without a groan,
  nor did the approaching evil change the natural beauty of her skin. And
  then rushing to her chamber, and her bed, there indeed she wept and spoke
  thus: "O bridal bed, whereon I loosed my virgin zone with this man, for
  whom I die, farewell! for I hate thee not; but me alone hast thou lost;
  for dreading to betray thee, and my husband, I die; but thee some other
  woman will possess, more chaste there can not, but perchance more
  fortunate."<a name="Alc_14"></a><a
  href="#AlcN_14"><sup>[14]</sup></a>&mdash;And falling on it she kissed
  it; but all the bed was bathed with the flood that issued from her eyes.
  But when she had satiety of much weeping, she goes hastily forward,<a
  name="Alc_15"></a><a href="#AlcN_15"><sup>[15]</sup></a> rushing from the
  bed. And ofttimes having left her chamber, she oft returned, and threw
  herself upon the bed again. And her children, hanging to the garments of
  their mother, wept; but she, taking them in her arms, embraced them,
  first one and then the other, as about to die. But all the domestics wept
  throughout the house, bewailing their mistress, but she stretched out her
  right hand to each, and there was none so mean, whom she addressed not,
  and was answered in return. Such are the woes in the house of Admetus.
  And had he died indeed, he would have perished; but now that he has
  escaped death, he has grief to that degree which he will never
  forget.</p>

  <p>CHOR. Surely Admetus groans at these evils, if he must be deprived of
  so excellent a wife.</p>

  <p>ATT. Yes, he weeps, holding his dear wife in his hands, and prays her
  not to leave him, asking impossibilities; for she wastes away, and is
  consumed by sickness, but fainting a wretched burden in his arms, yet
  still though but feebly breathing, she fain would glance toward the rays
  of the sun; as though never again, but now for the last time she is to
  view the sun's beam and his orb. But I will go and announce your
  presence, for it is by no means all that are well-wishers to their lords,
  so as to come kindly to them in their misfortunes; but you of old are
  friendly to my master.</p>

  <p>SEMICH. O Jove, what means of escape can there in any way be, and what
  method to rid us of the fortune which attends my master?</p>

  <p>SEMICH. Will any appear? or must I cut my locks, and clothe me even
  now in black array of garments?</p>

  <p>SEMICH. 'Tis plain, my friends, too plain; but still let us pray to
  the Gods, for the power of the Gods is mightiest.</p>

  <p>SEMICH. O Apollo, king of healing, find out some remedy for the evils
  of Admetus, procure it, O! procure it. For before this also thou didst
  find <i>remedy</i>, and now become our deliverer from death, and stop the
  murderous Pluto.</p>

  <p>SEMICH. Alas! alas! woe! woe! O son of Pheres, how didst thou fare
  when thou wert deprived of thy wife?</p>

  <p>SEMICH. Alas! alas! these things would even justify self-slaughter,
  and there is more, than whereat one might thrust one's neck in the
  suspending noose.<a name="Alc_16"></a><a
  href="#AlcN_16"><sup>[16]</sup></a></p>

  <p>SEMICH. For not a dear, but a most dear wife, wilt thou see dead this
  day.</p>

  <p>SEMICH. Behold, behold; lo! she doth come from the house, and her
  husband with her. Cry out, O groan, O land of Pheres, for the most
  excellent woman, wasting with sickness, <i>departing</i> beneath the
  earth to the infernal Pluto. Never will I aver that marriage brings more
  joy than grief, forming my conjectures both from former things, and
  beholding this fortune of the king; who, when he has lost this most
  excellent wife, will thenceforward pass a life not worthy to be called
  life.<a name="Alc_17"></a><a href="#AlcN_17"><sup>[17]</sup></a></p>

  <p>ADM. Ah me! I hear this sad word, and more than any death to me. Do
  not by the Gods have the heart to leave me: do not by those children,
  whom thou wilt make orphans: but rise, be of good courage: for, thee
  dead, I should no longer be: for on thee we depend both to live, and not
  to live: for thy love we adore.</p>

  <p>ALC. Admetus, thou seest both thy affairs and mine, in what state they
  are, I wish to tell thee, ere I die, what I would have done. I, honoring
  thee, and causing thee at the price of my life to view this light, die,
  it being in my power not to die, for thee: but though I might have
  married a husband from among the Thessalians whom I would, and have lived
  in a palace blessed with regal sway, was not willing to live, bereft of
  thee, with my children orphans; nor did I spare myself, though possessing
  the gifts of bloomy youth, wherein I delighted. And yet thy father and
  thy mother forsook thee, though they had well arrived at a point of life,
  in which they might have died, and nobly delivered their son, and died
  with glory: for thou wert their only one, and there was no hope, when
  thou wert dead, that they could have other children.<a
  name="Alc_20"></a><a href="#AlcN_20"><sup>[20]</sup></a> And I should
  have lived, and thou, the rest of our time. And thou wouldst not be
  groaning deprived of thy wife, and wouldst not have to bring up thy
  children orphans. But these things indeed, some one of the Gods hath
  brought to pass, that they should be thus. Be it so&mdash;but do thou
  remember to give me a return for this; for never shall I ask thee for an
  equal one, (for nothing is more precious than life,) but just, as thou
  wilt say: for thou lovest not these children less than I do, if thou art
  right-minded; them bring up lords over my house, and bring not in second
  marriage a step-mother over these children, who, being a worse woman than
  me, through envy will stretch out her hand against thine and my children.
  Do not this then, I beseech thee; for a step-mother that is in second
  marriage is enemy to the children of the former marriage, no milder than
  a viper. And my boy indeed has his father, a great tower of defense; but
  thou, O my child, how wilt thou be, brought up during thy virgin years?
  Having what consort of thy father's? <i>I fear</i>, lest casting some
  evil obloquy on thee, she destroys thy marriage in the bloom of youth.<a
  name="Alc_21"></a><a href="#AlcN_21"><sup>[21]</sup></a> For neither will
  thy mother ever preside over thy nuptials, nor strengthen thee being
  present, my daughter, at thy travails, where nothing is more kind than a
  mother. For I needs must die, and this evil comes upon me not to-morrow,
  nor on the third day of the month, but immediately shall I be numbered
  among those that are no more. Farewell, and may you be happy; and thou
  indeed, my husband, mayst boast, that thou hadst a most excellent wife,
  and you, my children, that you were born of a most excellent mother.</p>

  <p>CHOR. Be of good cheer; for I fear not to answer for him: he will do
  this, if he be not bereft of his senses.</p>

  <p>ADM. These things shall be so, they shall be, fear not: since I, when
  alive also, possessed thee <i>alone</i>, and when thou art dead, thou
  shalt be my only wife, and no Thessalian bride shall address me in the
  place of thee: there is not woman who shall, either of so noble a sire,
  nor otherwise most exquisite in beauty. But my children are enough; of
  these I pray the Gods that I may have the enjoyment; for thee we do not
  enjoy. But I shall not have this grief for thee for a year, but as long
  as my life endures, O lady, abhorring her indeed that brought me forth,
  and hating my father; for they were in word, not in deed, my friends. But
  thou, giving what was dearest to thee for my life, hast rescued me. Have
  I not then reason to groan deprived of such a wife? But I will put an end
  to the feasts, and the meetings of those that drink together, and garland
  and song, which wont to dwell in my house. For neither can I any more
  touch the lyre, nor lift up my heart to sing to the Libyan flute; for
  thou hast taken away my joy of life. But by the cunning hand of artists
  imaged thy figure shall be lain on my bridal bed, on which I will fall,
  and clasping my hands around, calling on thy name, shall fancy that I
  hold my dear wife in mine arms, though holding her not:<a

  I ween; but still I may draw off the weight that sits upon my soul: and
  in my dreams visiting me, thou mayst delight me, for a friend is sweet
  even to behold at night, for whatever time he may come. But if the tongue
  of Orpheus and his strain were mine, so that invoking with hymns the
  daughter of Ceres or her husband, I could receive thee from the shades
  below, I would descend, and neither the dog of Pluto, nor Charon at his
  oar, the ferryman of departed spirits, should stay me before I brought
  thy life to the light. But there expect me when I die and prepare a
  mansion for me, as about to dwell with me. For I will enjoin these<a

  the same cedar with thee, and to lay my side near thy side: for not even
  when dead may I be separated from thee, the only faithful one to me!</p>

  <p>CHOR. And I indeed with thee, as a friend with a friend, will bear
  this painful grief for her, for she is worthy.</p>

  <p>ALC. My children, ye indeed hear your father saying that he will never
  marry another wife to be over you, nor dishonor me.</p>

  thee.</p>

  hear, O mother. I beseech thee; I, I now call thee, mother, thy young one
  falling on thy mouth&mdash;</p>

  <p>ADM. Who hears not, neither sees: so that I and you are struck with a
  heavy calamity.</p>

  <p>EUM. Young and deserted, my father, am I left by my dear mother: O! I
  that have suffered indeed dreadful deeds!&mdash;and thou hast suffered

  her didst thou arrive at the end of old age, for she perished before, but
  thou being gone, mother, the house is undone.</p>

  <p>CHOR. Admetus, you must bear this calamity; for in no wise the first,
  nor the last of mortals hast thou lost thy dear wife: but learn, that to
  die is a debt we must all of us discharge.</p>

  <p>ADM. I know it, and this evil hath not come suddenly on me; but
  knowing it long ago I was afflicted. But be present, for I will have the
  corse borne forth, and while ye stay, chant a hymn to the God below that
  accepteth not libations. And all the Thessalians, over whom I reign, I
  enjoin to share in the grief for this lady, by shearing <i>their
  locks</i> with steel, and by arraying themselves in sable garb. And
  harness<a name="Alc_24"></a><a href="#AlcN_24"><sup>[24]</sup></a> your
  teams of horses to your chariots, and cut from your single steeds the
  manes that fall upon their necks. And let there be no noise of pipes, nor
  of the lyre throughout the city for twelve completed moons. For none
  other corse more dear shall I inter, nor one more kind toward me. But she
  deserves to receive honor from me, seeing that she alone hath died for
  me.</p>

<p class="center">CHORUS.</p>

  <p>O daughter of Pelias, farewell where thou dwellest in sunless dwelling
  within the mansions of Pluto. And let Pluto know, the God with ebon
  locks, and the old man, the ferryman of the dead, who sits intent upon
  his oar and his rudder, that he is conducting by far the most excellent
  of women in his two-oared boat over the lake of Acheron. Oft shall the
  servants of the Muses sing of thee, celebrating thee both on the
  seven-stringed lute on the mountains, and in hymns unaccompanied by the
  lyre: in Sparta, when returns the annual circle in the season of the
  Carnean month,<a name="Alc_25"></a><a href="#AlcN_25"><sup>[25]</sup></a>
  when the moon is up the whole night long; and in splendid<a
  name="Alc_26"></a><a href="#AlcN_26"><sup>[26]</sup></a> and happy
  Athens. Such a song hast thou left by thy death to the minstrels of
  melodies. Would that it rested with me, and that I could waft thee to the
  light from the mansions of Pluto, and from Cocytus' streams, by the oar
  of that infernal river. For thou, O unexampled, O dear among women, thou
  didst dare to receive thy husband from the realms below in exchange for
  thine own life. Light may the earth from above fall upon thee, lady! and
  if thy husband chooses any other alliance, surely he will be much
  detested by me and by thy children. When his mother was not willing for
  him to hide her body in the ground, nor his aged father, but these two
  wretches, having hoary locks, dared not to rescue him they brought forth,
  yet thou in the vigor of youth didst depart, having died for thy husband.
  May it be mine to meet with another<a name="Alc_27"></a><a
  href="#AlcN_27"><sup>[27]</sup></a> such a dear wife; for rare in life is
  such a portion, for surely she would live with me forever without once

  Cycnus, and I come to this third combat, about to engage with the horses

  <p>HER. I know nothing more; for thou speakest things obscure.</p>

  with?</p>

  happens.</p>

  <p>ADM. He that is about to die is dead, and he that is dead is no
  more.</p>

  <p>HER. The being and the not being is considered a different thing.</p>

  <p>ADM. You judge in this way, Hercules, but I in that.</p>

  <p>HER. Why then dost weep? Who is he of thy friends that is dead?</p>

  <p>ADM. A woman, a woman we were lately mentioning.</p>

  <p>HER. A stranger by blood, or any by birth allied to thee?</p>

  <p>ADM. A stranger; but on other account dear to this house.</p>

  guest.</p>

  thou, having thrown open the guest-chamber that is separate from the
  house: and tell them that have the management, that there be plenty of
  meats; and shut the gates in the middle of the hall: it is not meet that
  feasting guests should hear groans, nor should they be made sad.</p>

  Admetus, hast thou the heart to receive guests? wherefore art thou
  foolish?</p>

  the city, would you have praised me rather? No in sooth, since my
  calamity had been no whit the less, but I the more inhospitable: and in
  addition to my evils, there had been this other evil, that mine should be
  called the stranger-hating house. But I myself find this man a most
  excellent host, whenever I go to the thirsty land of Argos.</p>

  thou thyself sayest, came?</p>

  known aught of my sufferings. And to him<a name="Alc_29"></a><a

  toward that dusky <i>part of the heavens</i>, where the sun stays
  his horses, makes the clime of the Molossians the limit, and
  holds dominion as far as the portless shore of the Ægean Sea

  href="#AlcN_33"><sup>[33]</sup></a> and may it be well with thee even in
  the mansions of Pluto! I affirm that such marriages are profitable to
  men, or that it is not meet to marry.</p>

  <p>ADM. Neither hast thou come bidden of me to this funeral, nor do I
  count thy presence among things acceptable. But she here never shall put
  on thy decorations; for in no wise shall she be buried indebted to what
  thou hast. Then oughtest thou to have grieved with me, when I was in
  danger of perishing.<a name="Alc_34"></a><a
  href="#AlcN_34"><sup>[34]</sup></a> But dost thou, who stoodest aloof,
  and permittedst another, a young person, thyself being old, to die, weep
  over this dead body? Thou wert not then really the father of me, nor did
  she, who says she bore me, and is called my mother, bear me; but born of
  slavish blood I was secretly put under the breast of thy wife. Thou
  showedst when thou camest to the test, who thou art; and I deem that I am
  not thy son. Or else surely thou exceedest all in nothingness of soul,
  who being of the age thou art, and having come to the goal of life,
  neither hadst the will nor the courage to die for thy son; but sufferedst
  this stranger lady, whom alone I might justly have considered both mother
  and father. And yet thou mightst have run this race for glory, hadst thou
  died for thy son. But at any rate the remainder of the time thou hadst to
  live was short: and I should have lived and she the rest of our days, and
  I should not, bereft of her, be groaning at my miseries. And in sooth
  thou didst receive as many things as a happy man should receive; thou
  passedst the vigor of thine age indeed in sovereign sway, but I was thy
  son to succeed thee in this palace, so that thou wert not about to die
  childless and leave a desolate house for others to plunder. Thou canst
  not however say of me, that I gave thee up to die, dishonoring thine old
  age, whereas I was particularly respectful toward thee; and for this
  behavior both thou, and she that bare me, have made me such return.
  Wherefore you have no more time to lose<a name="Alc_35"></a><a
  href="#AlcN_35"><sup>[35]</sup></a> in getting children, who will succor
  thee in thine old age, and deck thee when dead, and lay out thy corse;
  for I will not bury thee with this mine hand; for I in sooth died, as far
  as in thee lay; but if, having met with, another deliverer, I view the
  light, I say that I am both his child, and the friendly comforter of his
  old age. In vain then do old men pray to be dead, complaining of age, and
  the long time of life: but if death come near, not one is willing to die,
  and old age is no longer burdensome to them.<a name="Alc_36"></a><a
  href="#AlcN_36"><sup>[36]</sup></a></p>

  <p>CHOR. Desist, for the present calamity is sufficient; and do not, O
  son, provoke thy father's mind.</p>

  <p>PHE. O son, whom dost thou presume thou art gibing with thy
  reproaches, a Lydian or a Phrygian bought with thy money?<a
  name="Alc_37"></a><a href="#AlcN_37"><sup>[37]</sup></a> Knowest thou not
  that I am a Thessalian, and born from a Thessalian father, truly free?
  Thou art too insolent, and casting the impetuous words of youth against
  us, shalt not having cast them thus depart. But I begat thee the lord of
  my house, and brought thee up, but I am not thy debtor to die for thee;
  for I received no paternal law like this, nor Grecian law, that fathers
  should die for their children; for for thyself thou wert born, whether
  unfortunate or fortunate, but what from us thou oughtest to have, thou
  hast. Thou rulest indeed over many, and I will leave thee a large demesne
  of lands, for these I received from my father. In what then have I
  injured thee? Of what do I deprive thee? Thou joyest to see the light,
  and dost think thy father does not joy?<a name="Alc_38"></a><a
  href="#AlcN_38"><sup>[38]</sup></a> Surely I count the time we must spend
  beneath long, and life is short, but still sweet. Thou too didst
  shamelessly fight off from dying, and livest, having passed over thy
  destined fate, by slaying her; then dost thou talk of my nothingness of
  soul, O most vile one, when thou art surpassed by a woman who died for
  thee, the handsome youth? But thou hast made a clever discovery, so that
  thou mayst never die, if thou wilt persuade the wife that is thine from
  time to time to die for thee: and then reproachest thou thy friends who
  are not willing to do this, thyself being a coward? Hold thy peace, and
  consider, if thou lovest thy life, that all love theirs; but if thou
  shalt speak evil against us, thou shalt hear many reproaches and not
  false ones.</p>

  <p>CHOR. Too many evil things have been spoken both now and before, but
  cease, old man, from reviling thy son.</p>

  <p>ADM. Speak, for I have spoken; but if thou art grieved at hearing the
  truth, thou shouldst not err against me.</p>

  <p>PHE. But had I died for thee, I had erred more.</p>

  <p>ADM. What? is it the same thing for a man in his prime, and for an old
  man to die?</p>

  <p>PHE. We ought to live with one life, not with two.</p>

  <p>ADM. Mayst thou then live a longer time than Jove!</p>

  <p>PHE. Dost curse thy parents, having met with no injustice?</p>

  <p>ADM. <i>I said it</i>, for I perceived thou lovedst a long life.</p>

  <p>PHE. But art not thou bearing forth this corse instead of thyself?</p>

  <p>ADM. A proof this, O most vile one, of thy nothingness of soul.</p>

  <p>PHE. She died not by us at least; thou wilt not say this.</p>

  <p>ADM. Alas! Oh that you may ever come to need my aid!</p>

  <p>PHE. Wed many wives, that more may die.</p>

  <p>ADM. This is a reproach to thyself, for thou wert not willing to
  die.</p>

  <p>PHE. Sweet is this light of the God, sweet is it.</p>

  <p>ADM. Base is thy spirit and not that of men.</p>

  <p>PHE. Thou dost not laugh as carrying an aged corse.</p>

  <p>ADM. Thou wilt surely however die inglorious, when thou diest.</p>

  <p>PHE. To bear an evil report is no matter to me when dead.</p>

  <p>ADM. Alas! alas! how full of shamelessness is old age!</p>

  <p>PHE. She was not shameless: her you found mad.</p>

  <p>ADM. Begone, and suffer me to bury this dead.</p>

  <p>PHE. I will depart; but you will bury her, yourself being her
  murderer. But you will render satisfaction to your wife's relatives yet:
  or surely Acastus no longer ranks among men, if he shall not revenge the
  blood of his sister.</p>

  <p>ADM. Get thee gone, then, thou and thy wife; childless, thy child yet
  living, as ye deserve, grow old; for ye no more come into the same house
  with me: and if it were necessary for me to renounce by heralds thy
  paternal hearth, I would renounce it. But let us (for the evil before us
  must be borne) proceed, that we may place the corse upon the funeral
  pyre.</p>

  <p>CHOR. O! O! unhappy because of thy bold deed, O noble, and by far most
  excellent, farewell! may both Mercury<a name="Alc_39"></a><a

<p class="center">SERVANT.</p>

  <p>I have now known many guests, and from all parts of the earth that
  have come to the house of Admetus, to whom I have spread the feast, but
  never yet did I receive into this house a worse one than this stranger.
  Who, in the first place, indeed, though he saw my master in affliction,
  came in, and prevailed upon himself to pass the gates. And then not at
  all in a modest manner received he the entertainment that there happened
  to be, when he heard of the calamity: but if we did not bring any thing,
  he hurried us to bring it. And having taken in his hands the cup wreathed
  with ivy,<a name="Alc_40"></a><a href="#AlcN_40"><sup>[40]</sup></a> he
  quaffs the neat wine of the purple mother, until the fumes of the liquor
  coming upon him inflamed him; and he crowns his head with branches of
  myrtles howling discordantly; and there were two strains to hear; for he
  was singing, not caring at all for the afflictions of Admetus, but we the
  domestics, were bewailing our mistress, and we showed not that we were
  weeping to the guest, for thus Admetus commanded. And now indeed I am
  performing the offices of hospitality to the stranger in the house, some
  deceitful thief and robber. But she is gone from the house, nor did I
  follow, nor stretched out my hand in lamentation for my mistress, who was
  a mother to me, and to all the domestics, for she saved us from ten
  thousand ills, softening the anger of her husband. Do I not then justly
  hate this stranger, who is come in our miseries?</p>

<p class="center">HERCULES, SERVANT.</p>

  <p>HER. Ho there! why dost thou look so grave and thoughtful? The servant
  ought not to be of woeful countenance before guests, but should receive
  them with an affable mind. But thou, though thou seest a companion of thy
  lord present, receivest him with a morose and clouded countenance, fixing
  thy attention on a calamity that thou hast nothing to do with. Come
  hither, that thou mayst become more wise. Knowest thou mortal affairs, of
  what nature they are? I think not; from whence should you? but hear me.
  Death is a debt that all mortals must pay: and there is not of them one,
  who knows whether he shall live the coming morrow: for what depends on
  fortune is uncertain how it will turn out, and is not to be learned,
  neither is it detected by art. Having heard these things then, and
  learned them from me, make thyself merry, drink, and think the life
  allowed from day to day thine own, but the rest Fortune's. And honor also
  Venus, the most sweet of deities to mortals, for she is a kind deity. But
  let go these other things, and obey my words, if I appear to speak
  rightly: I think so indeed. Wilt thou not then leave off thy excessive
  grief, and drink with me, crowned with garlands, having thrown open these
  gates? And well know I that the trickling of the cup falling down <i>thy
  throat</i> will change thee from thy present cloudy and pent state of
  mind. But we who are mortals should think as mortals. Since to all the
  morose, indeed, and to those of sad countenance, if they take me as judge
  at least, life is not truly life, but misery.</p>

  <p>SERV. I know this; but now we are in circumstances not such as are fit
  for revel and mirth.</p>

  <p>HER. The lady that is dead is a stranger; grieve not too much, for the
  lords of this house live.</p>

  <p>SERV. What live! knowest thou not the misery within the house?</p>

  <p>HER. Unless thy lord hath told me any thing falsely.</p>

  <p>SERV. He is too, too hospitable.</p>

  <p>HER. Is it unmeet that I should be well treated, because a stranger is
  dead?</p>

  <p>SERV. Surely however she was very near.</p>

  <p>HER. Has he forborne to tell me any calamity that there is?</p>

  <p>SERV. Depart and farewell; we have a care for the evils of our
  lords.</p>

  <p>HER. This speech is the beginning of no foreign loss.</p>

  <p>SERV. For I should not, <i>had it been foreign</i>, have been grieved
  at seeing thee reveling.</p>

  <p>HER. What! have I received so great an injury from mine host?</p>

  <p>SERV. Thou camest not in a fit time for the house to receive thee, for
  there is grief to us, and thou seest that we are shorn, and our black
  garments.</p>

  <p>HER. But who is it that is dead? Has either any of his children died,
  or his aged father?</p>

  <p>SERV. The wife indeed of Admetus is dead, O stranger.</p>

  <p>HER. What sayst thou? and yet did ye receive me?</p>

  <p>SERV. <i>Yes</i>, for he had too much respect to turn thee from his
  house.</p>

  <p>HER. O unhappy man, what a wife hast thou lost!</p>

  <p>SERV. We all are lost, not she alone.</p>

  <p>HER. But I did perceive it indeed, when I saw his eye streaming with
  tears, and his shorn hair, and his countenance; but he persuaded me,
  saying, that he was conducting the funeral of a stranger to the tomb: but
  spite of my inclination having passed over these gates, I drank in the
  house of the hospitable man, while he was in this case, and reveled,
  crowned as to my head with garlands. But 'twas thine to tell me not <i>to
  do it</i>, when such an evil was upon the house. Where is he burying her?
  whither going can I find her?</p>

  <p>SERV. By the straight road that leads to Larissa, thou wilt see the
  polished tomb beyond the suburbs.</p>

<p class="center">HERCULES.</p>

  <p>O my much-daring heart and my soul, now show what manner of son the
  Tirynthian Alcmena, daughter of Electryon, bare thee to Jove. For I must
  rescue the woman lately dead, Alcestis, and place her again in this
  house, and perform this service for Admetus. And going I will lay wait
  for the sable-vested king of the departed, Death, and I think that I
  shall find him drinking of the libations near the tomb. And if having
  taken him by lying in wait, rushing from my ambush, I shall seize hold of
  him, and make a circle around him with mine arms, there is not who shall
  take him away panting as to his sides, until he release me the woman. But
  if however I fail of this capture, and he come not to the clottered mass
  of blood, I will go a journey beneath to the sunless mansions of Cora and
  her king, and will prefer my request; and I trust that I shall bring up
  Alcestis, so as to place her in the hands of that host, who received me
  into his house, nor drove me away, although struck with a heavy calamity,
  but concealed it, noble as he was, having respect unto me. Who of the
  Thessalians is more hospitable than he? Who that dwelleth in Greece?
  Wherefore he shall not say, that he did a service to a worthless man,
  himself being noble.</p>

<p class="center">ADMETUS, CHORUS.</p>

  <p>ADM. Alas! alas! O hateful approach, and hateful prospect of this
  widowed house. Oh me! Alas! alas! whither can I go! where rest! what can
  I say! and what not! would that I could perish! Surely my mother brought
  me forth to heavy fortune. I count the dead happy, them I long for! those
  houses I desire to dwell in: for neither delight I in viewing the
  sunbeams, nor treading with my foot upon the earth; of such a hostage has
  death robbed me, and delivered up to Pluto.</p>

  <p>CHOR. Advance, advance; go into the recesses of the house.</p>

  <p>(ADM. Oh! Oh!)</p>

  <p>Thou hast suffered things that demand groans.</p>

  <p>(ADM. Alas! alas!)</p>

  <p>Thou hast gone through grief, I well know.</p>

  <p>(ADM. Woe! Woe!)</p>

  <p>Thou nothing aidest her that is beneath.</p>

  <p>(ADM. Ah me! me!)</p>

  <p>Never to see thy dear wife's face again before thee, is severe.</p>

  <p>ADM. Thou hast made mention of that which ulcerated my soul; for what
  can be greater ill to man than to lose his faithful wife? Would that I
  never had married and dwelt with her in the palace. But I judge happy
  those, who are unmarried and childless; for theirs is one only life, for
  this to grieve is a moderate burden: but to behold the diseases of
  children, and the bridal bed wasted by death, is not supportable, when it
  were in one's power to be without children and unmarried the whole of
  life.</p>

  <p>CHOR. Fate, fate hard to be struggled with hath come.</p>

  <p>(ADM. Oh! Oh!)</p>

  <p>But puttest thou no bound to thy sorrows?</p>

  <p>(ADM. Alas! alas!)</p>

  <p>Heavy are they to bear, but still</p>

  <p>(ADM. Woe! woe!)</p>

  <p>endure, thou art not the first man that hast lost</p>

  <p>(ADM. Ah me! me!)</p>

  <p>thy wife; but calamity appearing afflicts different men in different
  shapes.</p>

  <p>ADM. O lasting griefs, and sorrows for our friends beneath the
  earth!&mdash;Why did you hinder me from throwing myself<a
  name="Alc_41"></a><a href="#AlcN_41"><sup>[41]</sup></a> into her
  hallowed grave, and from lying dead with her, by far the most excellent
  woman? And Pluto would have retained instead of one, two most faithful
  souls having together passed over the infernal lake.</p>

  <p>CHOR. I had a certain kinsman, whose son worthy to be lamented, an
  only child, died in his house; but nevertheless he bore his calamity with
  moderation, being bereft of child, though now hastening to gray hairs,
  and advanced in life.</p>

  <p>ADM. O house, how can I enter in? and how dwell in thee now my fortune
  has undergone this change? Ah me! for there is great difference between:
  then indeed with Pelian torches, and with bridal songs I entered in,
  bearing the hand of my dear wife, and there followed a loud-shouting
  revelry hailing happy both her that is dead and me, inasmuch as being
  noble, and born of illustrious parents both, we were united together: but
  now the groan instead of hymeneals, and black array instead of white
  robes, usher me in to my deserted couch.</p>

  <p>CHOR. This grief came quick on happy fortune to thee unschooled in
  evil: but thou hast saved thy life. Thy wife is dead, she left her love
  behind: what new thing this? Death has ere this destroyed many wives.</p>

  <p>ADM. My friends, I deem the fortune of my wife more happy than mine
  own, even although these things appear not so. For her indeed no grief
  shall ever touch, and she hath with glory ceased from many toils. But I,
  who ought not to have lived, though I have scaped destiny, shall pass a
  bitter life; I but now perceive. For how can I bear the entering into
  this house? Whom speaking to, or by whom addressed,<a
  name="Alc_42"></a><a href="#AlcN_42"><sup>[42]</sup></a> can I have joy
  in entering? Whither shall I turn me? For the solitude within will drive
  me forth, when I see the place where my wife used to lie, empty, and the
  seat whereon she used to sit, and the floor throughout the house all
  dirty, and when my children falling about my knees weep their mother, and
  they lament their mistress, <i>thinking</i> what a lady they have lost
  from out of the house. Such things within the house; but abroad the
  nuptials of the Thessalians and the assemblies full of women will torture
  me: for I shall not be able to look on the companions of my wife. But
  whoever is mine enemy will say thus of me: "See that man, who basely
  lives, who dared not to die, but giving in his stead her, whom he
  married, escaped Hades, (and then does he seem to be a man?) and hates
  his parents, himself not willing to die."&mdash;Such report shall I have
  in addition to my woes; why then is it the more honorable course for me
  to live, my friends, having an evil character and an evil fortune?</p>

  <p>CHOR. I too have both been borne aloft through song, and having very
  much handled arguments have found nothing more powerful than Necessity:
  nor is there any cure in the Thracian tablets which Orpheus<a
  name="Alc_43"></a><a href="#AlcN_43"><sup>[43]</sup></a> wrote, nor among
  those medicines, which Ph&#339;bus gave the sons of Æsculapius,
  dispensing<a name="Alc_44"></a><a href="#AlcN_44"><sup>[44]</sup></a>
  them to wretched mortals. But neither to the altars nor to the image of
  this Goddess alone, is it lawful to approach, she hears not victims. Do
  not, O revered one, come on me more severe, than hitherto in my life. For
  Jove, whatever he have assented to, with thee brings this to pass. Thou
  too perforce subduest the iron among the Chalybi; nor has thy rugged
  spirit any remorse.</p>

  <p>And thee, <i>Admetus</i>, the Goddess hath seized in the inevitable
  grasp of her hand; but bear it, for thou wilt never by weeping bring back
  on earth the dead from beneath. Even the sons of the Gods by stealth
  begotten perish in death. Dear she was while she was with us, and dear
  even now when dead. But thou didst join to thy bed<a name="Alc_45"></a><a
  href="#AlcN_45"><sup>[45]</sup></a> the noblest wife of all women. Nor
  let the tomb of thy wife be accounted as the mound over the dead that
  perish, but let it be honored equally with the Gods, a thing for
  travelers to adore:<a name="Alc_46"></a><a
  href="#AlcN_46"><sup>[46]</sup></a> and some one, going out of his direct
  road, shall say thus: "She in olden time died for her husband, but now
  she is a blest divinity: Hail, O adored one, and be propitious!" Such
  words will be addressed to her.&mdash;And lo! here comes, as it seems,
  the son of Alcmena to thy house, Admetus.</p>

<p class="center">HERCULES, ADMETUS, CHORUS.</p>

  <p>HER. One should speak freely to a friend, Admetus, and, not in silence
  keep within our bosoms what we blame. Now I thought myself worthy as a
  friend to stand near thy calamities, and to search them out;<a
  name="Alc_47"></a><a href="#AlcN_47"><sup>[47]</sup></a> but thou didst
  not tell me that it was thy wife's corse that demanded thy attention; but
  didst receive me in thy house, as though occupied in grief for one not
  thine. And I crowned my head and poured out to the Gods libations in thy
  house which had suffered this calamity. And I <i>do</i> blame thee, I
  blame thee, having met with this treatment! not that I wish to grieve
  thee in thy miseries. But wherefore I am come, having turned back again,
  I will tell thee. Receive and take care of this woman for me, until I
  come hither driving the Thracian mares, having slain the king of the
  Bistonians. But if I meet with what I pray I may not meet with, (for may
  I return!) I give thee her as an attendant of thy palace. But with much
  toil came she into my hands; for I find some who had proposed a public
  contest for wrestlers, worthy of my labors, from whence I bear off her,
  having received her as the prize of my victory; for those who conquered
  in the lighter exercises had to receive horses, but those again who
  conquered in the greater, the boxing and the wrestling, cattle, and a
  woman was added to these; but in me, who happened to be there, it had
  been base to neglect this glorious gain. But, as I said, the woman ought
  to be a care to you, for I am come not having obtained her by stealth,
  but with labor; but at some time or other thou too wilt perhaps commend
  me for it.</p>

  <p>ADM. By no means slighting thee, nor considering thee among mine
  enemies, did I conceal from thee the unhappy fate of my wife; but this
  had been a grief added to grief, if thou hadst gone to the house of
  another host: but it was sufficient for me to weep my own calamity. But
  the woman, if it is in any way possible, I beseech thee, O king, bid some
  one of the Thessalians, who has not suffered what I have, to take care of
  (but thou hast many friends among the Pheræans) lest thou remind me of my
  misfortunes. I can not, beholding her in the house, refrain from weeping;
  add not a sickness to me already sick; for I am enough weighed down with
  misery. Where besides in the house can a youthful woman be maintained?
  for she is youthful, as she evinces by her garb and her attire; shall she
  then live in the men's apartment? And how will she be undefiled, living
  among young men? A man in his vigor, Hercules, it is no easy thing to
  restrain; but I have a care for thee. Or can I maintain her, having made
  her enter the chamber of her that is dead? And how can I introduce her
  into her bed? I fear a double accusation, both from the citizens, lest
  any should convict me of having betrayed my benefactress, and lying in
  the bed of another girl; and I ought to have much regard toward the dead
  (and she deserves my respect). But thou, O lady, whoever thou art, know
  that thou hast the same size of person with Alcestis, and art like her in
  figure. Ah me! take by the Gods this woman from mine eyes, lest you
  destroy me already destroyed. For I think, when I look upon her, that I
  behold my wife; and it agitates my heart, and from mine eyes the streams
  break forth; O unhappy I, how lately did I begin to taste this bitter
  grief!</p>

  <p>CHOR. I can not indeed speak well of thy fortune; but it behooves
  thee, whatever thou art, to bear with firmness the dispensation of the
  Gods.</p>

  <p>HER. Oh would that I had such power as to bring thy wife to the light
  from the infernal mansions, and to do this service for thee!</p>

  <p>ADM. Well know I that thou hast the will: but how can this be? It is
  not possible for the dead to come into the light.</p>

  <p>HER. Do not, I pray, go beyond all bound, but bear it decently,</p>

  <p>ADM. Tis easier to exhort, than suffering to endure.</p>

  <p>HER. But what advantage can you gain if you wish to groan forever?</p>

  <p>ADM. I know that too myself; but a certain love impels me.</p>

  <p>HER. For to love one that is dead draws the tear.</p>

  <p>ADM. She hath destroyed me, and yet more than my words express.</p>

  <p>HER. Thou hast lost an excellent wife; who will deny it?</p>

  <p>ADM. <i>Ay,</i> so that I am no longer delighted with life.</p>

  <p>HER. Time will soften the evil, but now it is yet in its vigor<a
  name="Alc_48"></a><a href="#AlcN_48"><sup>[48]</sup></a> on thee.</p>

  <p>ADM. Time thou mayst say, if to die be time.</p>

  <p>HER. A wife will bid it cease, and the desire of a new marriage.</p>

  <p>ADM. Hold thy peace&mdash;What saidst thou? I could not have supposed
  it.</p>

  <p>HER. But why? what, wilt not marry, but pass a widowed life alone?</p>

  <p>ADM. There is no woman that shall lie with me.</p>

  <p>HER. Dost thou think that thou art in aught benefiting her that is
  dead?</p>

  <p>ADM. Her, wherever she is, I am bound to honor.</p>

  <p>HER. I praise you indeed, I praise you; but you incur the charge of

  <p>ADM. <i>Praise me, or praise me not;</i> for you shall never call me
  bridegroom.</p>

  <p>HER. I do praise thee, because thou art a faithful friend to thy
  wife.</p>

  <p>ADM. May I die, when I forsake her, although she is not!</p>

  <p>HER. Receive then this noble woman into thine house.</p>

  <p>ADM. Do not, I beseech thee by thy father Jove.</p>

  <p>HER. And yet you will be acting wrong, if you do not this.</p>

  <p>ADM. Yes, and if I do it, I shall have my heart gnawed with
  sorrow.</p>

  <p>HER. Be prevailed upon: perhaps this favor may be proved a duty.</p>

  <p>ADM. Ah! would that you had never borne her off from the contest!</p>

  <p>HER. Yet with me conquering thou'rt victorious too.</p>

  <p>ADM. Thou hast well spoken; but let the woman depart.</p>

  <p>HER. She shall depart, if it is needful; but first see whether it be
  needful.</p>

  <p>ADM. It is needful, if thou at least dost not mean to make me
  angry.</p>

  <p>HER. I too have this desire, for I know somewhat.</p>

  <p>ADM. Conquer then. Thou dost not however do things pleasing to me.</p>

  <p>HER. But some time or other thou wilt praise me; only be
  persuaded.</p>

  <p>ADM. Lead her in, if I must receive her in my house.</p>

  <p>HER. I will not deliver up the woman into the charge of the
  servants.</p>

  <p>ADM. But do thou thyself lead her into the house if it seems fit.</p>

  <p>HER. I then will give her into thine hands.</p>

  <p>ADM. I will not touch her; but she is at liberty to enter the
  house.</p>

  <p>HER. I trust her to thy right hand alone.</p>

  <p>ADM. O king, thou compellest me to do this against my will.</p>

  <p>HER. Dare to stretch out thy hand and touch the stranger.</p>

  <p>ADM. And in truth I stretch it out, as I would to the Gorgon with her
  severed head.<a name="Alc_49"></a><a
  href="#AlcN_49"><sup>[49]</sup></a></p>

  <p>HER. Have you her?</p>

  <p>ADM. I have.</p>

  <p>HER. Then keep her fast; and some time or other thou wilt say that the
  son of Jove is a generous guest. But look on her, whether she seems aught
  to resemble thy wife; and being blest leave off from thy grief.</p>

  <p>ADM. O Gods, what shall I say? An unexpected wonder this! Do I truly
  see here my wife, or does the mocking joy of the Deity strike me from my
  senses?</p>

  <p>HER. It is not so; but thou beholdest here thy wife.</p>

  <p>ADM. Yet see, whether this be not a phantom from the realms
  beneath.</p>

  <p>HER. Thou hast not made thine host an invoker of spirits.</p>

  <p>ADM. But do I behold my wife, whom I buried?</p>

  <p>HER. Be well assured <i>thou dost;</i> but I wonder not at thy
  disbelief of thy fortune.</p>

  <p>ADM. May I touch her, may I speak to her as my living wife?<a
  name="Alc_50"></a><a href="#AlcN_50"><sup>[50]</sup></a></p>

  <p>HER. Speak to her; for thou hast all that thou desirest.</p>

  <p>ADM. O face and person of my dearest wife, have I thee beyond my
  hopes, when I thought never to see thee more?</p>

  <p>HER. Thou hast: but <i>take care</i> there be no envy of the Gods.</p>

  <p>ADM. O noble son of the most powerful Jove, mayst thou be blest, and
  may thy father, who begot thee, protect thee, for thou alone hast
  restored me! How didst thou bring her from beneath into this light!</p>

  <p>HER. Having fought a battle with the prince of those beneath.</p>

  <p>ADM. Where dost thou say thou didst have this conflict with Death!</p>

  <p>HER. At the tomb itself, having seized him from ambush with my
  hands.</p>

  <p>ADM. But why, I pray, does this woman stand here speechless?</p>

  <p>HER. It is not yet allowed thee to hear her address thee, before she
  is unbound from her consecrations<a name="Alc_51"></a><a
  href="#AlcN_51"><sup>[51]</sup></a> to the Gods beneath, and the third
  day come. But lead her in, and as thou oughtest, henceforward, Admetus,
  continue in thy piety with respect to strangers. And farewell! But I will
  go and perform the task that is before me for the imperial son of
  Sthenelus.</p>

  <p>ADM. Stay with us, and be a companion of our hearth.</p>

  <p>HER. This shall be some time hence, but now I must haste.</p>

  <p>ADM. But mayst thou be prosperous, and return on thy journey back. But
  to the citizens, and to all the tetrarchy I issue my commands, that they
  institute dances in honor of these happy events, and make the altars
  odorous with their sacrifices of oxen that accompany their vows. For now
  are we placed in a better state of life than the former one: for I will
  not deny that I am happy.</p>

  <p>CHOR. Many are the shapes of the things the deities direct, and many
  things the Gods perform contrary to our expectations. And those things
  which we looked for are not accomplished; but the God hath brought to
  pass things not looked for. Such hath been the event of this affair.</p>

  <p>Bacchus, the son of Jove by Semele, had made Thebes, his mother's
  birth-place, his favorite place of abode and worship. Pentheus, the then
  reigning king, who, as others say, preferred the worship of Minerva,
  slighted the new God, and persecuted those who celebrated his revels.
  Upon this, Bacchus excited his mother Agave, together with the sisters of
  Semele, Autonoe and Ino, to madness, and visiting Pentheus in disguise of
  a Bacchanal, was at first imprisoned, but, easily escaping from his
  bonds, he persuaded Pentheus to intrude upon the rites of the Bacchants.
  While surveying them from a lofty tree, the voice of Bacchus was heard
  inciting the Bacchants to avenge themselves upon the intruder, and they
  tore the miserable Pentheus piecemeal. The grief and banishment of Agave
  for her unwitting offense conclude the play.</p>

<h2>THE BACCHÆ.<a name="Ba_1"></a><a href="#BaN_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></h2>

<p class="center">BACCHUS.</p>

  <p>I, Bacchus, the son of Jove, am come to this land of the Thebans, whom
  formerly Semele, the daughter of Cadmus, brought forth, delivered by the
  lightning-bearing flame. And having taken a mortal form instead of a
  God's, I am present at the fountains of Dirce and the water of Ismenus.
  And I see the tomb of my thunder-stricken mother here near the palace,
  and the remnants of the house smoking, and the still living name of
  Jove's fire, the everlasting insult of Juno against my mother. But I
  praise Cadmus, who has made this place hallowed, the shrine of his
  daughter; and I have covered it around with the cluster-bearing leaf of
  the vine. And having left the wealthy lands of the Lydians and Phrygians,
  and the sun-parched plains of the Persians, and the Bactrian walls; and
  having come over the stormy land of the Medes, and the happy Arabia, and
  all Asia which lies along the coast of the salt sea, having fair-towered
  cities full of Greeks and barbarians mingled together; and there having
  danced and established my mysteries, that I might be a God manifest among
  men, I have come to this city first of the Grecian [cities,] and I have
  raised my shout first in Thebes of this land of Greece, fitting a
  deer-skin on my body, and taking a thyrsus in my hand, an ivy-clad<a
  name="Ba_2"></a><a href="#BaN_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> weapon, because the
  sisters of my mother, whom, it least of all became, said that I, Bacchus,
  was not born of Jove; but that Semele, having conceived by some mortal,
  charged the sin of her bed upon Jove, a trick of Cadmus; on which account
  they said that Jove had slain her, because she told a false tale about
  her marriage. Therefore I have now driven them from the house with
  frenzy, and they dwell on the mountain, insane of mind; and I have
  compelled them to wear the dress of my mysteries. And all the female seed
  of the Cadmeans, as many as are women, have I driven maddened from the
  house. And they, mingled with the sons of Cadmus, sit on the roofless
  rocks beneath the green pines. For this city must know, even though it be
  unwilling, that it is not initiated into my Bacchanalian rites, and that
  I plead the cause of my mother, Semele, in appearing manifest to mortals
  as a God whom she bore to Jove. Cadmus then gave his honor and power to
  Pentheus, born from his daughter, who fights against the Gods as far as I
  am concerned, and drives me from sacrifices, and in his prayers makes no
  mention of me; on which account I will show him and all the Thebans that
  I am a God. And having set matters here aright, manifesting myself, I
  will move to another land. But if the city of the Thebans should in anger
  seek by arms to bring down the Bacchæ from the mountain, I, general of
  the Mænads, will join battle.<a name="Ba_3"></a><a
  href="#BaN_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> On which account I have changed my form
  to a mortal one, and transformed my shape into the nature of a man. But,
  O ye who have left Tmolus, the bulwark of Lydia; ye women, my assembly,
  whom I have brought from among the barbarians as assistants and
  companions to me; take your drums, your native instruments in the
  Phrygian cities, the invention of the mother Rhea<a name="Ba_4"></a><a
  href="#BaN_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> and myself, and coming beat them around
  this royal palace of Pentheus, that the city of Cadmus may see it. And I,
  with the Bacchæ, going to the dells of Cithæron, where they are, will
  share their dances.</p>

  <p>CHOR. Coming from the land of Asia, having left the sacred Tmolus, I
  dance in honor of Bromius, a sweet labor and a toil easily borne,
  celebrating the god Bacchus. Who is in the way? who is in the way? who is
  in the halls? Let him depart. And let every one be pure as to his mouth
  speaking propitious things; for now I will with hymns celebrate Bacchus
  according to custom:&mdash;Blessed is he,<a name="Ba_5"></a><a
  href="#BaN_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> whoever being favored, knowing the
  mysteries of the gods, keeps his life pure, and has his soul initiated
  into the Bacchic revels, dancing o'er the mountains with holy
  purifications, and reverencing the mysteries of the mighty mother Cybele,
  and brandishing the thyrsus, and being crowned with ivy, serves Bacchus!
  Go, ye Bacchæ; go, ye Bacchæ, escorting Bromius, a God, the son of a God,
  from the Phrygian mountains to the broad streets of Greece! Bromius! whom
  formerly, being in the pains of travail, the thunder of Jove flying upon
  her, his mother cast from her womb, leaving life by the stroke of the
  thunder-bolt. And immediately Jupiter, the son of Saturn, received him in
  a chamber fitted for birth; and covering him in his thigh, shuts him with
  golden clasps hidden from Juno. And he brought him forth, when the Fates
  had perfected the horned God, and crowned him with crowns of snakes,
  whence the thyrsus-bearing Mænads are wont to cover their prey with their
  locks. O Thebes, thou nurse of Semele, crown thyself with ivy, flourish,
  flourish with the verdant yew bearing sweet fruit, and be ye crowned in
  honor of Bacchus with branches of oak or pine, and adorn your garments of
  spotted deer-skin with fleeces of white-haired sheep,<a
  name="Ba_6"></a><a href="#BaN_6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> and sport in holy
  games with the insulting wands, straightway shall all the earth dance,
  when Bromius leads the bands to the mountain, to the mountain, where the
  female crowd abides, away from the distaff and the shuttle,<a
  name="Ba_7"></a><a href="#BaN_7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> driven frantic by
  Bacchus. O dwelling of the Curetes, and ye divine Cretan caves,<a
  name="Ba_8"></a><a href="#BaN_8"><sup>[8]</sup></a> parents to Jupiter,
  where the Corybantes with the triple helmet invented for me in their
  caves this circle o'erstretched with hide; and with the constant
  sweet-voiced breath of Phrygian pipes they mingled a sound of Bacchus,
  and put the instrument in the hand of Rhea, resounding with the sweet
  songs of the Bacchæ. And hard by the raving satyrs went through the
  sacred rites of the mother Goddess. And they added the dances of the
  Trieterides;<a name="Ba_9"></a><a href="#BaN_9"><sup>[9]</sup></a> in
  which Bacchus rejoices; pleased on the mountains, when after the running
  dance he falls upon the plain, having a sacred garment of deer-skin,
  seeking a sacrifice of goats, a raw-eaten delight,<a name="Ba_10"></a><a
  href="#BaN_10"><sup>[10]</sup></a> on his way to the Phrygian, the Lydian
  mountains; and the leader is Bromius, Evoe!<a name="Ba_11"></a><a
  href="#BaN_11"><sup>[11]</sup></a> but the plain flows with milk, and
  flows with wine, and flows with the nectar of bees; and the smoke is as
  of Syrian frankincense. But Bacchus bearing a flaming torch of pine on
  his thyrsus, rushes about arousing in his course the wandering Choruses,
  and agitating them with shouts, casting his rich locks loose in the
  air,&mdash;and with his songs he shouts out such words as this: O go
  forth, ye Bacchæ; O go forth, ye Bacchæ, delight of gold-flowing Tmolus.
  Sing Bacchus 'neath the loud drums, Evoe, celebrating the God Evius in
  Phrygian cries and shouts. When the sweet-sounding sacred pipe sounds a
  sacred playful sound suited to the frantic wanderers, to the mountain, to
  the mountain&mdash;and the Bacchant rejoicing like a foal with its mother
  at pasture, stirs its swift foot in the dance.</p>

  <p>TIRESIAS. Who at the doors will call out Cadmus from the house, the
  son of Agenor, who, leaving the city of Sidon, erected this city of the
  Thebans? Let some one go, tell him that Tiresias seeks him; but he
  himself knows on what account I come, and what agreement I, an old man,
  have made with him, yet older; to twine the thyrsi, and to put on the
  skins of deer, and to crown the head with ivy branches.</p>

  <p>CADMUS. O dearest friend! how I, being in the house, was delighted,
  hearing your voice, the wise voice of a wise man; and I am come prepared,
  having this equipment of the God; for we needs must extol him, who is the
  son sprung from my daughter, Bacchus, who has appeared as a God to men,
  as much as is in our power. Whither shall I dance, whither direct the
  foot, and wave the hoary head? Do you lead me, you, an old man! O
  Tiresias, direct me, an old man; for you are wise. Since I shall never
  tire, neither night nor day, striking the earth with the thyrsus. Gladly
  we forget that we are old.</p>

  <p>TI. You have the same feelings indeed as I; for I too feel young, and
  will attempt the dance.</p>

  <p>CA. Then we will go to the mountain in chariots.<a name="Ba_12"></a><a
  href="#BaN_12"><sup>[12]</sup></a></p>

  <p>TI. But thus the God would not have equal honor.</p>

  <p>CA. I, an old man, will lead you, an old man.<a name="Ba_13"></a><a
  href="#BaN_13"><sup>[13]</sup></a></p>

  <p>TI. The God will without trouble guide us thither.</p>

  <p>CA. But shall we alone of the city dance in honor of Bacchus?</p>

  <p>TI. [Ay,] for we alone think rightly, but the rest ill.</p>

  <p>CA. We are long in delaying;<a name="Ba_14"></a><a
  href="#BaN_14"><sup>[14]</sup></a> but take hold of my hand.</p>

  <p>TI. See, take hold, and join your hand to mine.</p>

  <p>CA. I do not despise the Gods, being a mortal.</p>

  <p>TI. We do not show too much wiseness about the Gods. Our ancestral
  traditions, and those which we have kept throughout our life, no argument
  will overturn them; not if any one were to find out wisdom with the
  highest genius. Some one will say that I do not respect old age, being
  about to dance, having crowned my head with ivy; for the God has made no
  distinction as to whether it becomes the young man to dance, or the
  elder; but wishes to have common honors from all; but does not at all
  wish to be extolled by a few.</p>

  <p>CA. Since you, O Tiresias, do not see this light, I will be to you an
  interpreter of things. Hither is Pentheus coming to the house in haste,
  the son of Echion, to whom I give power over the land. How fluttered he
  is! what strange thing will he say?</p>

  <p>PENTHEUS. I happened to be at a distance from this land, and I hear of
  strange evils in this city, that the women have left our palace in
  mad-wandering Bacchic rites; and that they are rushing about in the shady
  mountains, honoring with dances this new God Bacchus, whoever he is; and
  that full goblets stand in the middle of their assemblies, and that
  flying each different ways into secrecy, they yield to the embraces of
  men, on pretence, indeed, as [being] worshiping Mænads; but that they
  consider Venus before Bacchus. As many then as I have taken, the servants
  keep them bound as to their hands in the public strong-holds, and as many
  as are absent I will hunt from the mountain, Ino, and Agave who bore me
  to Echion, and the mother of Actæon, I mean Autonoe; and having bound
  them in iron fetters, I will soon stop them from this ill-working
  revelry. And they say that some stranger has come hither, a juggler, a
  charmer, from the Lydian land, fragrant in hair with golden curls,
  florid, having in his eyes the graces of Venus, who days and nights is
  with them, alluring the young maidens with Bacchic mysteries&mdash;but if
  I catch him under this roof, I will stop him from making a noise with the
  thyrsus, and waving his hair, by cutting off his neck from his body. He
  says he is the God Bacchus, [He was once on a time sown in the thigh of
  Jove,<a name="Ba_15"></a><a href="#BaN_15"><sup>[15]</sup></a> ] who was
  burned in the flame of lightning, together with his mother, because she
  falsely claimed nuptials with Jove. Are not these things deserving of a
  terrible halter, for a stranger to insult us with these insults, whoever
  he be? But here is another marvel&mdash;I see Tiresias the soothsayer, in
  dappled deer-skins, and the father of my mother, most great absurdity,
  raging about with a thyrsus&mdash;I deprecate it, O father, seeing your
  old age destitute of sense; will you not dash away the ivy?<a
  name="Ba_16"></a><a href="#BaN_16"><sup>[16]</sup></a> will you not, O
  father of my mother, put down your hand empty of the thyrsus? Have you
  persuaded him to this, O Tiresias? do you wish, introducing this new God
  among men, to examine birds and to receive rewards for fiery omens? If
  your hoary old age did not defend you, you should sit as a prisoner in
  the midst of the Bacchæ, for introducing these wicked rites; for where
  the joy of the grape-cluster is present at a feast of women, I no longer
  say any thing good of their mysteries.</p>

  <p>CHOR. Alas for his impiety! O host, do you not reverence the Gods! and
  being son of Echion, do you disgrace your race and Cadmus, who sowed the
  earth-born crop?</p>

  <p>TI. When any wise man takes a good occasion for his speech, it is not
  a great task to speak well; but you have a rapid tongue, as if wise, but
  in your words there is no wisdom; but a powerful man, when bold, and able
  to speak, is a bad citizen if he has not sense. And this new God, whom
  you ridicule, I am unable to express how great he will be in Greece. For,
  O young man, two things are first among men; Ceres, the goddess, and she
  is the earth, call her whichever name you will.<a name="Ba_17"></a><a
  href="#BaN_17"><sup>[17]</sup></a> She nourishes mortals with dry food;
  but he who is come as a match to her, the son of Semele, has invented the
  liquid drink of the grape, and introduced it among mortals, which
  delivers miserable mortals from grief,<a name="Ba_18"></a><a
  href="#BaN_18"><sup>[18]</sup></a> when they are filled with the stream
  of the vine; and gives sleep an oblivion of daily evils: nor is there
  any other medicine for troubles. He who is a God is poured out in
  libations to the Gods, that by his means men may have good
  things&mdash;and you laugh at him, as to how he was sewn up in the thigh
  of Jove; I will teach you that this is well&mdash;when Jove snatched him
  out of the lightning flame, and bore him, a young infant, up to Olympus,
  Juno wished to cast him down from heaven; but Jove had a counter
  contrivance, as being a God. Having broken a part of the air which
  surrounds the earth, he placed in it, giving him as a pledge, Bacchus,
  safe from Juno's enmity; and in time, mortals say, that he was nourished
  in the thigh of Jove; changing his name, because a God gave him formerly
  as a pledge to a Goddess, they having made agreement.<a
  name="Ba_19"></a><a href="#BaN_19"><sup>[19]</sup></a> But this God is a
  prophet&mdash;for Bacchanal excitement and frenzy have much divination in
  them.<a name="Ba_20"></a><a href="#BaN_20"><sup>[20]</sup></a> For when
  the God comes violent<a name="Ba_21"></a><a
  href="#BaN_21"><sup>[21]</sup></a> into the body, he makes the frantic to
  foretell the future; and he also possesses some quality of Mars; for
  terror flutters sometimes an army under arms and in its ranks, before
  they touch the spear; and this also is a frenzy from Bacchus. Then you
  shall see him also on the Delphic rocks, bounding with torches along the
  double-pointed district, tossing about, and shaking the Bacchic branch,
  mighty through Greece. But be persuaded by me, O Pentheus; do not boast
  that sovereignty has power among men, nor, even if you think so, and your
  mind is disordered, believe that you are at all wise. But receive the God
  into the land, and sacrifice to him, and play the Bacchanal, and crown
  your head. Bacchus will not compel women to be modest<a
  name="Ba_22"></a><a href="#BaN_22"><sup>[22]</sup></a> with regard to
  Venus, but in his nature modesty in all things is ever innate. This you
  must needs consider, for she who is modest will not be corrupted by being
  at Bacchanalian revels. Dost see? Thou rejoicest when many stand at thy
  gates, and the city extols the name of Pentheus; and he, I ween, is
  pleased, when honored. I, then, and Cadmus whom you laugh to scorn, will
  crown ourselves with ivy, and dance, a hoary pair; but still we must
  dance; and I will not contend against the Gods, persuaded by your
  words&mdash;for you rave most grievously; nor can you procure any cure
  from medicine, nor are you now afflicted beyond their power.<a
  name="Ba_23"></a><a href="#BaN_23"><sup>[23]</sup></a></p>

  <p>CHOR. O old man, thou dost not shame Apollo by thy words, and honoring
  Bromius, the mighty God, thou art wise.</p>

  <p>CAD. My son, well has Tiresias advised you; dwell with us, not away
  from the laws. For now you flit about, and though wise are wise in
  naught; for although this may not be a God, as you say, let it be said by
  you that he is; and tell a glorious falsehood, that Semele may seem to
  have borne a God, and that honor may redound to all our race. You see the
  hapless fate of Actæon,<a name="Ba_24"></a><a
  href="#BaN_24"><sup>[24]</sup></a> whom his blood-thirsty hounds, whom he
  had reared up, tore to pieces in the meadows, having boasted that he was
  superior in the chase to Diana. This may you not suffer; come, that I may
  crown thy head with ivy, with us give honor to the God&mdash;</p>

  <p>PEN. Do not bring your hand toward me; but departing, play the
  Bacchanal, and wipe not off your folly on me; but I will follow up with
  punishment this teacher of your madness; let some one go as quickly as
  possible, and going to his seat where he watches the birds, upset and
  overthrow it with levers, turning every thing upside down; and commit his
  crowns to the winds and storms; for doing this, I shall gnaw him most.
  And some of you going along the city, track out this effeminate stranger,
  who brings this new disease upon women, and pollutes our beds. And if you
  catch him, convey him hither bound; that meeting with a judgment of
  stoning he may die, having seen a bitter revelry of Bacchus in
  Thebes.</p>

  <p>TI. O wretched man! how little knowest thou what thou sayest! You are
  mad now, and before you was out of your mind. Let us go, O Cadmus, and
  entreat the God, on behalf of him, savage though he be, and on behalf of
  the city, to do him no ill: but follow me with the ivy-clad staff, and
  try to support my body, and I will yours; for it would be shameful for
  two old men to fall down: but let that pass, for we must serve Bacchus,
  the son of Jove; but beware lest Pentheus bring grief into thy house, O
  Cadmus. I do not speak in prophecy, but judging from the state of things,
  for a foolish man says foolish things.</p>

  <p>CHOR. O holy venerable Goddess! holy, who bearest thy golden pinions
  along the earth, hearest thou these words of Pentheus? Hearest thou his
  unholy insolence against Bromius, the son of Semele, the first deity of
  the Gods, at the banquets where the guests wear beautiful chaplets! who
  has this office, to join in dances, and to laugh with the flute, and to
  put an end to cares, when the juice of the grape comes at the feast of
  the Gods, and in the ivy-bearing banquets the goblet sheds sleep over
  man? Of unbridled mouths and lawless folly misery is the end, but the
  life of quiet and wisdom remains unshaken, and supports a house; for the
  heavenly powers are afar indeed, but still inhabiting the air, they
  behold the deeds of mortals. But cleverness<a name="Ba_25"></a><a
  href="#BaN_25"><sup>[25]</sup></a> is not wisdom, nor is the thinking on
  things unfit for mortals. Life is short; and in it who, pursuing great
  things, would not enjoy the present? These are the manners of maniacs;
  and of ill-disposed men, in my opinion. Would that I could go to Cyprus,
  the island of Venus, where the Loves dwell, soothing the minds of
  mortals, and to Paphos, which the waters of a foreign river flowing with
  an hundred<a name="Ba_26"></a><a href="#BaN_26"><sup>[26]</sup></a>
  mouths, fertilize without rain&mdash;and to the land of Pieria, where is
  the beautiful seat of the Muses, the holy hill of Olympus. Lead me
  thither, O Bromius, Bromius, O master thou of Bacchanals! There are the
  Graces, and there is Love, and there is it lawful for the Bacchæ to
  celebrate their orgies; the God, the son of Jove, delights in banquets,
  and loves Peace, giver of riches, the Goddess the nourisher of youths.
  And both to the rich and the poor<a name="Ba_27"></a><a
  href="#BaN_27"><sup>[27]</sup></a> has she granted to enjoy an equal
  delight from wine, banishing grief; and he who does not care for these
  things, hates to lead a happy life by day and by friendly night&mdash;but
  it is wise<a name="Ba_28"></a><a href="#BaN_28"><sup>[28]</sup></a> to
  keep away the mind and intellect proceeding from over-curious men; what
  the baser multitude thinks and adopts, that will I say.</p>

  <p>SERVANT. Pentheus, we are here; having caught this prey, for which you
  sent us: nor have we gone in vain; but the beast was docile in our hands,
  nor did he withdraw his foot in flight, but yielded not unwillingly; nor
  did he [turn] pale nor change his wine-complexioned cheek, but laughing,
  allowed us to bind and lead him away; and remained still, making my work
  easy; and I for shame said, O stranger, I do not take you of my own will,
  but by order of Pentheus who sent me. And the Bacchæ whom you shut up,
  whom you carried off and bound in the chains of the public prison, they
  being set loose are escaped, and are dancing in the meadows, invoking
  Bromius as their God, and of their own accord the fetters were loosed
  from their feet, and the keys opened the doors without mortal hand, and
  full of many wonders is this man come to Thebes; but the rest must be thy
  care.</p>

  <p>PEN. Take hold of him by the hands; for being in the toils, he is not
  so swift as to escape me: but in your body you are not ill-formed, O
  stranger, for women's purposes, on which account you have come to Thebes.
  For your hair is long, not through wrestling, scattered over your cheeks,
  full of desire, and you have a white skin from careful preparation;
  hunting after Venus by your beauty not exposed to strokes of the sun, but
  [kept] beneath the shade. First then tell me who thou art in family.</p>

  <p>BAC. There is no boast; but this is easy to say; thou knowest by
  hearsay of the flowery Tmolus?</p>

  <p>PEN. I know, [the hill] which surrounds the city of Sardis.</p>

  <p>BAC. Thence am I; and Lydia is my country.</p>

  <p>PEN. And whence do you bring these rites into Greece?</p>

  <p>BAC. Bacchus persuaded us, the son of Jove.</p>

  <p>PEN. Is Jove then one who begets new Gods?</p>

  <p>BAC. No, but having married Semele here,&mdash;</p>

  <p>PEN. Did he compel you by night, or in your sight [by day]?</p>

  <p>BAC. Seeing me who saw him; and he gave me orgies.</p>

  <p>PEN. And what appearance have these orgies?</p>

  <p>BAC. It is unlawful for the uninitiated among mortals to know.</p>

  <p>PEN. And have they any profit to those who sacrifice?</p>

  <p>BAC. It is not lawful for you to hear, but they are worth knowing.</p>

  <p>PEN. You have well coined this story, that I may wish to hear.</p>

  <p>BAC. The orgies of the God hate him who works impiety.</p>

  <p>PEN. For you say, forsooth, that you saw the God clearly what he was
  like?</p>

  <p>BAC. As he chose; I did not order this.</p>

  <p>PEN. This too you have well contrived, saying mere nonsense.</p>

  <p>BAC. One may seem, speaking wisely to one ignorant, not to be
  wise.</p>

  <p>PEN. And did you come hither first, bringing the God?</p>

  <p>BAC. Every one of the barbarians celebrates these orgies.</p>

  <p>PEN. [Ay,] for they are much less wise than Greeks.</p>

  <p>BAC. In these things they are wiser, but their laws are different.</p>

  <p>PEN. Do you practice these rites at night, or by day?</p>

  <p>BAG. Most of them at night;<a name="Ba_29"></a><a
  href="#BaN_29"><sup>[29]</sup></a> darkness conveys awe.</p>

  <p>PEN. This is treacherous toward women, and unsound.</p>

  <p>BAC. Even by day some may devise base things.</p>

  <p>PEN. You must pay the penalty of your evil devices.</p>

  <p>BAC. And you of your ignorance, being impious to the God.</p>

  <p>PEN. How bold is Bacchus, and not unpracticed in speech.</p>

  <p>BAC. Say what I must suffer, what ill wilt thou do me?</p>

  <p>PEN. First I will cut off your delicate hair.</p>

  <p>BAC. The hair is sacred, I cherish it for the God.<a
  name="Ba_30"></a><a href="#BaN_30"><sup>[30]</sup></a></p>

  <p>PEN. Next yield up this thyrsus out of your hands.</p>

  <p>BAC. Take it from me yourself, I bear it as the ensign of Bacchus.</p>

  <p>PEN. And we will guard your body within in prison.</p>

  <p>BAC. The God himself will release me when I wish.<a
  name="Ba_31"></a><a href="#BaN_31"><sup>[31]</sup></a></p>

  <p>PEN. Ay, when you call him, standing among the Bacchæ.</p>

  <p>BAC. Even now, being near, he sees what I suffer.</p>

  <p>PEN. And where is he? for at least he is not apparent to my eyes.</p>

  <p>BAC. Near me, but you being impious, see him not.</p>

  <p>PEN. Seize him, he insults me and Thebes!</p>

  <p>BAC. I warn you not to bind me: I in my senses command you not in your
  senses.</p>

  <p>PEN. And I bid them to bind you, as being mightier than you.</p>

  <p>BAC. You know not why you live, nor what you do, nor who you are.</p>

  <p>PEN. Pentheus, son of Agave, and of my father Echion.</p>

  <p>BAC. You are suited to be miserable according to your name.<a
  name="Ba_32"></a><a href="#BaN_32"><sup>[32]</sup></a></p>

  <p>PEN. Begone! confine him near the stable of horses that he may behold
  dim darkness! There dance; and as for these women whom you bring with
  you, the accomplices in your wickedness, we will either sell them away,
  or stopping their hand from this noise and beating of skins, I will keep
  them as slaves at the loom.</p>

  <p>BAC. I will go&mdash;for what is not right it is not right to suffer;
  but as a punishment for these insults Bacchus shall pursue you, who you
  say exists not; for, injuring us, you put him in bonds.</p>

  <p>CHOR. O daughter of Achelous, venerable Dirce, happy virgin, for thou
  didst receive the infant of Jove in thy fountains when Jove who begat him
  saved him in his thigh from the immortal fire; uttering this shout: Go, O
  Dithyrambus, enter this my male womb, I will make you illustrious, O
  Bacchus, in Thebes, so that they shall call you by this name. But you, O
  happy Dirce, reject me having a garland-bearing company about you. Why
  dost thou reject me? Why dost thou avoid me? Yet, I swear by the
  clustering delights of the vine of Bacchus, yet shall you have a care for
  Bacchus. What rage, what rage does the earth-born race show, and Pentheus
  once descended from the dragon, whom the earth-born Echion begat, a
  fierce-faced monster, not a mortal man, but like a bloody giant, an enemy
  to the Gods, who will soon bind me, the handmaid of Bacchus, in halters,
  he already has within the house my fellow-reveler, hidden in a dark
  prison. Dost thou behold this, O son of Jove, Bacchus, thy prophets in
  the dangers of restraint? Come, O thou of golden face, brandishing your
  thyrsus along Olympus, and restrain the insolence of the blood-thirsty
  man. Where art thou assembling thy bands of thyrsus-bearers, O Bacchus,
  is it near Nysa which nourishes wild beasts, or in the summits of
  Corycus?<a name="Ba_33"></a><a href="#BaN_33"><sup>[33]</sup></a> or
  perhaps in the deep-wooded lairs of Olympus, where formerly Orpheus
  playing the lyre drew together the trees by his songs, collected the
  beasts of the fields; O happy Pieria, Evius respects you, and will come
  to lead the dance with revelings having crossed the swiftly-flowing
  Axius, he will bring the dancing Mænads, and [leaving] Lydia<a
  name="Ba_34"></a><a href="#BaN_34"><sup>[34]</sup></a> the giver of
  wealth to mortals, and the father whom I have heard fertilizes the
  country renowned for horses with the fairest streams.</p>

  <p>BAC. Io! hear ye, hear ye my song, Io Bacchæ! O Bacchæ!</p>

  <p>CHOR. Who is here, who? from what quarter did the shout of Evius
  summon me?</p>

  <p>BAC. Io, Io, I say again! I, the son of Semele, the son of Jove!</p>

  <p>CHOR. Io! Io! Master, master! come now to our company. O Bromius!
  Bromius! Shake this place, O holy Earth!<a name="Ba_35"></a><a
  href="#BaN_35"><sup>[35]</sup></a> O! O! quickly will the palace of
  Pentheus be shaken in ruin&mdash;Bacchus is in the halls. Worship him. We
  worship him. Behold these stone buttresses shaken with their pillars.
  Bacchus will shout in the palace.</p>

  <p>BAC. Light the burning fiery lamp; burn, burn the house of
  Pentheus.</p>

  <p>SEM. Alas! Dost thou not behold the fire, nor perceive around the
  sacred tomb of Semele the flame which formerly the bolt-bearing thunder
  of Jupiter left?</p>

  <p>SEM. Cast on the ground your trembling bodies, cast them down, O
  Mænads, for the king turning things upside down is coming to this palace,
  [Bacchus,] the son of Jupiter.</p>

  <p>BAC. O barbarian women! have ye fallen to the ground thus stricken
  with fear? Ye have felt, it seems, Bacchus shaking the house of Pentheus;
  but lift up your bodies, and take courage, casting off fear from your
  flesh.</p>

  <p>CHOR. O thou most mighty light to us of Evian Bacchic rites, how
  gladly do I see thee, being before alone and desolate!</p>

  <p>BAC. Ye came to despair, when I was sent in, as about to fall into the
  dark prison of Pentheus.</p>

  <p>CHOR. How not?&mdash;who was my guardian if you met with misfortune?
  but how were you liberated, having met with an impious man?</p>

  <p>BAC. I delivered myself easily without trouble.</p>

  <p>CHOR. And did he not bind your hands in links of chains?</p>

  <p>BAC. In this too I mocked him; for, thinking to bind me, he neither
  touched nor handled me, but fed on hope; and finding a bull in the
  stable, where having taken me, he confined me, he cast halters round the
  knees of that, and the hoofs of its feet;<a name="Ba_36"></a><a
  href="#BaN_36"><sup>[36]</sup></a> breathing out fury, stilling sweat
  from his body, gnashing his teeth in his lips. But I, being near, sitting
  quietly, looked on; and, in the mean time, Bacchus coming, shook the
  house, and kindled flame on the tomb of his mother; and he, when he saw
  it, thinking the house was burning, rushed to and fro, calling to the
  servants to bring water,<a name="Ba_37"></a><a
  href="#BaN_37"><sup>[37]</sup></a> and every servant was at work toiling
  in vain; and letting go this labor, I having escaped, seizing a dark
  sword he rushes into the house, and then Bromius, as it seems to me, I
  speak my opinion, made an appearance in the palace, and he rushing toward
  it, rushed on and stabbed at the bright air,<a name="Ba_38"></a><a
  href="#BaN_38"><sup>[38]</sup></a> as if slaying me; and besides this,
  Bacchus afflicts him with these other things; and threw down his house to
  the ground, and every thing was shivered in pieces, while he beheld my
  bitter chains; and from fatigue dropping his sword, he falls
  exhausted&mdash;for he being a man, dared to join battle with a God: and
  I quietly getting out of the house am come to you, not regarding
  Pentheus. But, as it seems to me, a shoe sounds in the house; he will
  soon come out in front of the house. What will he say after this? I shall
  easily bear him, even if he comes vaunting greatly, for it is the part of
  a wise man to practice prudent moderation.</p>

  <p>PEN. I have suffered terrible things, the stranger has escaped me, who
  was lately coerced in bonds. Hollo! here is the man; what is this? how do
  you appear near my house, having come out?</p>

  <p>BAC. Stay your foot; and substitute calm steps for anger.</p>

  <p>PEN. How come you out, having escaped your chains?</p>

  <p>BAC. Did I not say, or did you not hear, that some one would deliver
  me?</p>

  <p>PEN. Who? for you are always introducing strange things.</p>

  <p>BAC. He who produces the rich-clustering vine for mortals.</p>

  <p>PEN. This is a fine reproach you charge on Bacchus; I order ye to
  close every tower all round.</p>

  <p>BAC. Why? do not Gods pass over walls too?</p>

  <p>PEN. You are wise, wise at least in all save what you should be wise
  in.</p>

  <p>BAC. In what I most ought, in that I was born wise; but first learn,
  hearing his words who is come from the mountain to bring a message to
  you; but we will await you, we will not fly.</p>

  <p>MESSENGER. Pentheus, ruler o'er this Theban land, I come, having left
  Cithæron, where never have the brilliant flakes of white snow fallen.<a
  name="Ba_39"></a><a href="#BaN_39"><sup>[39]</sup></a></p>

  <p>PEN. But bringing what important news are you come?</p>

  <p>MESS. Having seen the holy Bacchæ, who driven by madness have darted
  their fair feet from this land, have I come, wishing to tell you and the
  city, O king, what awful things they do, things beyond marvel; and I wish
  to hear whether in freedom of speech I shall tell you the matters there,
  or whether I shall repress my report, for I fear, O king, the hastiness
  of thy mind, and your keen temper, and too imperious disposition.<a
  name="Ba_40"></a><a href="#BaN_40"><sup>[40]</sup></a></p>

  <p>PEN. Speak, as you shall be in all things blameless as far as I am
  concerned; for it is not meet to be wrath with the just; and in
  proportion as you speak worse things of the Bacchæ, so much the more will
  we punish this man who has taught these tricks to the women.</p>

  <p>MESS. I was just now driving up to the heights the herd of calves,
  when the sun sends forth his rays warming the land, and I see three
  companies of dances of women, of one of which Autonoe was chief; of a
  second, thy mother, Agave; and Ino led the third dance; and they were all
  sleeping, relaxed in their bodies, some resting their locks against the
  leaves of pine, and some laying their heads at random on the leaves of
  oak in the ground, modestly, not, as you say, that, drunk with the goblet
  and the noise of the flute, they solitary hunt Venus through the wood.
  But thy mother standing in the midst of the Bacchæ, raised a shout, to
  wake their bodies from sleep, when she heard the lowing of the horned
  oxen; but they, casting off refreshing sleep from their eyes, started
  upright, a marvel to behold for their elegance, young, old, and virgins
  yet unyoked, And first they let loose their hair over their shoulders;
  and arranged their deer-skins, as many as had had the fastenings of their
  knots unloosed, and they girded the dappled hides with serpents licking
  their jaws&mdash;and some having in their arms a kid, or the wild whelps
  of wolves, gave them white milk, all those who, having lately had
  children, had breasts still full, having left their infants, and they put
  on their ivy chaplets, and garlands of oak and blossoming yew; and one
  having taken a thyrsus, struck it against a rock, whence a dewy stream of
  water springs out; another placed her wand on the ground, and then the
  God sent up a spring of wine. And as many as had craving for the white
  drink, scratching the earth with the tips of their fingers, obtained
  abundance of milk; and from the ivy thyrsus sweet streams of honey
  dropped, so that, had you been present, beholding these things, you would
  have approached with prayers that God whom you now blame. And we came
  together, herdsmen and shepherds, to reason with one another concerning
  this strange matter, what terrible things and worthy of marvel they do;
  and some one, a wanderer about the city, and practiced in speaking, said
  to us all, O ye who inhabit the holy downs of the mountains, will ye that
  we hunt out Agave, the mother of Pentheus, back from the revels, and do
  the king a pleasure? And he seemed to us to speak well, and hiding
  ourselves, we lay in ambush in the foliage of the thickets; and they, at
  the appointed hour, waved the thyrsus in their solemnities, calling on
  Bacchus with united voice, the son of Jove, Bromius; and the whole
  mountain and the beasts were in a revel; and nothing was unmoved by their
  running; and Agave was bounding near to me, and I sprang forth, as
  wishing to seize her, leaving my ambush where I was hidden. But she cried
  out, O my fleet hounds, we are hunted by these men; but follow me,
  follow, armed with thyrsi in your hands. We then flying, avoided the
  tearing of the Bacchæ, but they sprang on the heifers browsing the grass
  with unarmed hand, and you might see one rending asunder a fatted lowing
  calf, and others rent open cows, and you might see either ribs, or a
  cloven-footed hoof, tossed here and there, and hanging beneath the
  pine-trees the fragments were dripping, dabbled in gore; and the fierce
  bulls before showing their fury with their horns, were thrown to the
  ground, overpowered by myriads of maiden hands; and quicker were the
  coverings of flesh torn asunder by the royal maids than you could shut
  your eyes; and like birds raised in their course, they proceed along the
  level plain, which by the streams of the Asopus produce the fertile crop
  of the Thebans, and falling on Hysiæ and Erythræ,<a name="Ba_41"></a><a
  href="#BaN_41"><sup>[41]</sup></a> which, are below Cithæron, they turned
  every thing upside down; they dragged children from the houses; and
  whatever they put on their shoulders stuck there without chains, and fell
  not on the dark plain, neither brass nor iron; and they bore fire on
  their tresses, and it burned not; but some from rage betook themselves to
  arms, being plundered by the Bacchæ, the sight of which was fearful to
  behold, O king! For their pointed spear was not made bloody, but the
  women hurling the thyrsi from their hands, wounded them, and turned their
  backs to flight, women [defeating] men; not without the aid of some God.
  And they went back again to whence they had departed, to the same
  fountains which the God had caused to spring up for them, and they washed
  off the blood; and the snakes with their tongues cleaned off the drops
  from their cheeks. Receive then, O master, this deity, whoever he be, in
  this city, since he is mighty in other respects, and they say this too of
  him, as I hear, that he has given mortals the vine which puts an end to
  grief,&mdash;for where wine exists not there is no longer Venus, nor any
  thing pleasant to men.<a name="Ba_42"></a><a
  href="#BaN_42"><sup>[42]</sup></a></p>

  <p>CHOR. I fear to speak unshackled words to the king, but still they
  shall be spoken; Bacchus is inferior to none of the Gods.</p>

  <p>PEN. Already like fire does this insolence of the Bacchæ extend thus
  near, a great reproach to the Greeks. But I must not hesitate; go to the
  Electra gates, bid all the shield-bearers and riders of swift-footed
  horses to assemble, and all who brandish the light shield, and twang with
  their hand the string of the bow, as we will make an attack upon the
  Bacchæ; but it is too much, if we are to suffer what we are suffering at
  the hands of women.</p>

  <p>BAC. O Pentheus, you obey not at all hearing my words; but although
  suffering ill at your hands, still I say that you ought not to take up
  arms against a God, but to rest quiet; Bromius will not endure your
  moving the Bacchæ from their Evian mountains.</p>

  <p>PEN. You shall not teach me; but be content,<a name="Ba_43"></a><a
  href="#BaN_43"><sup>[43]</sup></a> having escaped from prison, or else I
  will again bring punishment upon you.</p>

  <p>BAC. I would rather sacrifice to him than, being wrath, kick against
  the pricks; a mortal against a God.</p>

  <p>PEN. I will sacrifice, making a great slaughter of the women, as they
  deserve, in the glens of Cithæron.</p>

  <p>BAC. You will all fly, (and that will be shameful,) so as to yield
  your brazen shields to the thyrsi of the Bacchæ.</p>

  <p>PEN. We are troubled with this impracticable stranger, who neither
  suffering nor doing will be silent.</p>

  <p>BAC. My friend, there is still opportunity to arrange these things
  well.</p>

  <p>PEN. By doing what? being a slave to my slaves?</p>

  <p>BAC. I will bring the women here without arms.</p>

  <p>PEN. Alas! you are contriving some trick against me.</p>

  <p>BAC. Of what sort, if I wish to save you by my contrivances?</p>

  <p>PEN. You have devised this together, that ye may have your revelings
  forever.</p>

  <p>BAC. And indeed, know this, I agreed on it with the God.</p>

  <p>PEN. Bring hither the arms! and do you cease to speak.</p>

  <p>BAC. Hah! Do you wish to see them sitting on the mountains?</p>

  <p>PEN. Very much, if I gave countless weight of gold for it.</p>

  <p>BAC. But why? have you fallen into a great wish for this?</p>

  <p>PEN. I should like to see them drunk grievously [for them].</p>

  <p>BAC. Would you then gladly see what is grievous to you?</p>

  <p>PEN. To be sure, sitting quietly under the pines.</p>

  <p>BAC. But they will track you out, even though you come secretly.</p>

  <p>PEN. But [I will come] openly, for you have said this well.</p>

  <p>BAC. Shall I then guide you? and will you attempt the way?</p>

  <p>PEN. Lead me as quickly as possible; for I do not grudge you the
  time.</p>

  <p>BAC. Put on then linen garments on your body.</p>

  <p>PEN. What then, shall I be reckoned among women, being a man?</p>

  <p>BAC. Lest they slay you if you be seen there, being a man.</p>

  <p>PEN. You say this well, and you have been long wise.</p>

  <p>BAC. Bacchus taught me this wisdom.</p>

  <p>PEN. How then can these things which you advise me be well done?</p>

  <p>BAC. I will attire you, going into the house.</p>

  <p>PEN. With what dress&mdash;a woman's? but shame possesses me.</p>

  <p>BAC. Do you no longer wish to be a spectator of the Mænads?</p>

  <p>PEN. But what attire do you bid me put on my body?</p>

  <p>BAC. I will spread out your hair at length on your head.</p>

  <p>PEN. And what is the next point of my equipment?</p>

  <p>BAC. A garment down to your feet; and you shall have a turban on your
  head.</p>

  <p>PEN. Shall you put any thing else on me besides this?</p>

  <p>BAC. A thyrsus in your hand, and the dappled hide of a deer.</p>

  <p>PEN. I can not wear a woman's dress.</p>

  <p>BAC. But you will shed blood if you join battle with the Bacchæ.</p>

  <p>PEN. True; we must first go and see.</p>

  <p>BAC. That is wiser at least than to hunt evils with evils.</p>

  <p>PEN. And how shall I go through the city escaping the notice of the
  Cadmeans?</p>

  <p>BAC. We will go by deserted roads, and I will guide you.</p>

  <p>PEN. Every thing is better than for the Bacchæ to mock me.</p>

  <p>BAC. We will go into the house and consider what seems best.</p>

  <p>PEN. We can do what we like; my part is completely prepared. Let us
  go; for either I will go bearing arms, or I will be guided by your
  counsels.</p>

  <p>BAC. O women! the man is in the toils,<a name="Ba_44"></a><a
  href="#BaN_44"><sup>[44]</sup></a> and he will come to the Bacchæ, where,
  dying, he will pay the penalty. Now, Bacchus, 'tis thine office, for you
  are not far off. Let us punish him; but first drive him out of his wits,
  inspiring vain frenzy, since, being in his right mind, he will not be
  willing to put on a female dress, but driving him out of his senses he
  will put it on; and I wish him to furnish laughter to the Thebans, being
  led in woman's guise through the city, after<a name="Ba_45"></a><a
  href="#BaN_45"><sup>[45]</sup></a> his former threats, with which he was
  terrible. But I will go to fit on Pentheus the dress, which, having
  taken, he shall die, slain by his mother's hand. And he shall know
  Bacchus, the son of Jupiter, who is in fact to men at once the most
  terrible, and the mildest of deities.<a name="Ba_46"></a><a
  href="#BaN_46"><sup>[46]</sup></a></p>

  <p>CHOR. Shall I move my white foot in the night-long dance, honoring
  Bacchus, exposing my neck to the dewy air, sporting like a fawn in the
  verdant delights of the mead, when it has escaped a fearful chase beyond
  the watch of the well-woven nets, (and the huntsman cheering hastens on
  the course of his hounds,) and with toil like the swift storm<a
  name="Ba_47"></a><a href="#BaN_47"><sup>[47]</sup></a> rushes along the
  plain that skirts the river, exulting in the solitude apart from men, and
  in the thickets of the shady-foliaged wood? What is wisdom, what is a
  more glorious gift from the Gods among mortals than to hold one's hand on
  the heads of one's enemies? What is good is always pleasant; divine
  strength is roused with difficulty, but still is sure, and it chastises
  those mortals who honor folly, and do not extol the Gods in their insane
  mind. But the Gods cunningly conceal the long foot<a name="Ba_48"></a><a
  href="#BaN_48"><sup>[48]</sup></a> of time, and hunt the impious man; for
  it is not right to determine or plan any thing beyond the laws: for it is
  a light expense to deem that that has power whatever is divine, and that
  what has been law for a long time has its origin in nature. What is
  wisdom, what is a more noble gift from the Gods among men, than to hold
  one's hand on the heads of one's enemies? what is honorable is always
  pleasant. Happy is he who has escaped from the wave of the sea, and
  arrived in harbor.<a name="Ba_49"></a><a
  href="#BaN_49"><sup>[49]</sup></a> Happy, too, is he who has overcome his
  labors; and one surpasses another in different ways, in wealth and power.
  Still are there innumerable hopes to innumerable men, some result in
  wealth to mortals, and some fail, but I call him happy whose life is
  happy day by day.</p>

  <p>BAC. You, who are eager to see what you ought not, and hasty to do a
  deed not of haste, I mean Pentheus, come forth before the house, be seen
  by me, having the costume of a woman, of a frantic Bacchant, as a spy
  upon your mother and her company! In appearance, you are like one of the
  daughters of Cadmus.</p>

  <p>PEN. And indeed I think I see two suns,<a name="Ba_50"></a><a
  href="#BaN_50"><sup>[50]</sup></a> and twin Thebes, and seven-gated city;
  and you seem to guide me, being like a bull, and horns seem to grow on
  your head. But were you ever a beast? for you look like a bull.</p>

  <p>BAC. The God accompanies us, not propitious formerly, but now at truce
  with us. You see what you should see.</p>

  <p>PEN. How do I look? Does not my standing seem like that of Ino, or of
  Agave, my mother?</p>

  <p>BAC. I seem to see them as I behold you; but this lock of hair of
  yours is out of its place, not as I dressed it beneath the turban.</p>

  <p>PEN. Moving it within doors backward and forward, and practicing
  Bacchic revelry, I disarranged it.</p>

  <p>BAC. But we who ought to wait upon you will again rearrange it. But
  hold up your head.</p>

  <p>PEN. Look, do you arrange it, for we depend on you.</p>

  <p>BAC. And your girdle is loosened, and the fringes of your garments do
  not extend regularly round your legs.</p>

  <p>PEN. They seem so to me, too, about the right foot at least; but on
  this side the robe sits well along the leg.</p>

  <p>BAC. Will you not think me the first of your friends when, contrary to
  your expectation, you see the Bacchæ acting modestly?</p>

  <p>PEN. But shall I be more like a Bacchant holding the thyrsus in my
  right hand, or in this?</p>

  <p>BAC. You should [hold it in] your right hand, and raise it at the same
  time with your right foot; and I praise you for having changed your
  mind.</p>

  <p>PEN. Could I bear on my shoulders the glens of Cithæron, Bacchæ and
  all?</p>

  <p>BAC. You could if you were willing; but you had your mind unsound
  before; but now you have such as you ought.</p>

  <p>PEN. Shall we bring levers, or shall I tear them up with my hands,
  putting my shoulder or arm under the summits?</p>

  <p>BAC. No, lest you ruin the habitations of the Nymphs, and the seats of
  Pan where he plays his pipes.</p>

  <p>PEN. You speak well,&mdash;it is not with strength we should conquer
  women; but I will hide my body among the pines.</p>

  <p>BAC. Hide you the hiding in which you should be hidden, coming as a
  crafty spy on the Mænads.</p>

  <p>PEN. And, indeed, I think to catch them in the thickets, like birds in
  the sweet nets of beds.</p>

  <p>BAC. You go then as a watch for this very thing; and perhaps you will
  catch them, if you be not caught first.</p>

  <p>PEN. Conduct me through the middle of the Theban land, for I am the
  only man of them who would dare these things.</p>

  <p>BAC. You alone labor for this city, you alone; therefore the labors,
  which are meet,<a name="Ba_51"></a><a href="#BaN_51"><sup>[51]</sup></a>
  await you. But follow me, I am your saving guide, some one else will
  guide you away from thence.</p>

  <p>PEN. Yes, my mother.</p>

  <p>BAC. Being remarkable among all.</p>

  <p>PEN. For this purpose do I come.</p>

  <p>BAC. You will depart being borne.<a name="Ba_52"></a><a
  href="#BaN_52"><sup>[52]</sup></a></p>

  <p>PEN. You allude to my delicacy.</p>

  <p>BAC. In the hands of your mother.</p>

  <p>PEN. And wilt thou compel me to be effeminate?</p>

  <p>BAC. Ay, with such effeminacy.</p>

  <p>PEN. I lay mine hands to worthy things.</p>

  <p>BAC. You are terrible, terrible: and you go to terrible sufferings; so
  that you shall find a renown reaching to heaven. Spread out, O Agave,
  your hands, and ye, her sister, daughters of Cadmus! I lead this young
  man to a mighty contest; and the conqueror shall be I and Bacchus! The
  rest the matter itself will show.</p>

  <p>CHOR. Go, ye fleet hounds of madness, go to the mountain where the
  daughters of Cadmus hold their company; drive them raving against the
  frantic spy on the Mænads,&mdash;him in woman's attire. First shall his
  mother from some smooth rock or paling, behold him in ambush; and she
  will cry out to the Mænads: Who is this of the Cadmeans who has come to
  the mountain, the mountain, as a spy on us, who are on the mountain? Io
  Bacchæ! Who brought him forth? for he was not born of the blood of women:
  but, as to his race, he is either born of some lion, or of the Libyan
  Gorgons. Let manifest justice go forth, let it go with sword in hand,
  slaying the godless, lawless, unjust, earth-born offspring of Echion
  through the throat; who, with wicked mind and unjust rage about your
  orgies, O Bacchus, and those of thy mother,<a name="Ba_53"></a><a
  href="#BaN_53"><sup>[53]</sup></a> with raving heart and mad disposition
  proceeds as about to overcome an invincible deity by force. To possess
  without pretext a wise understanding in respect to the Gods, and [a
  disposition] befitting mortals, is a life ever free from grief. I
  joyfully hunt after wisdom, if apart from envy, but the other conduct is
  evidently ever great throughout life, directing one rightly the livelong
  day, to reverence things honorable.<a name="Ba_54"></a><a
  href="#BaN_54"><sup>[54]</sup></a> Appear as a bull, or a many-headed
  dragon, or a fiery lion, to be seen. Go, O Bacchus! cast a snare around
  the hunter of the Bacchæ, with a smiling face falling upon the deadly
  crowd of the Mænads.</p>

  <p>MESS. O house, which wast formerly prosperous in Greece! house of the
  Sidonian old man, who sowed in the land the earth-born harvest of the
  dragon; how I lament for you, though a slave. But still the [calamities]
  of their masters are a grief to good servants.</p>

  <p>CHOR. But what is the matter? Tellest thou any news from the
  Bacchæ?</p>

  <p>MESS. Pentheus is dead, the son of his father Echion.</p>

  <p>CHOR. O, king Bacchus! truly you appear a great God!</p>

  <p>MESS. How sayest thou? Why do you say this? Do you, O woman, delight
  at my master being unfortunate?</p>

  <p>CHOR. I, a foreigner, celebrate it in foreign strains; for no longer
  do I crouch in fear under my fetters.</p>

  <p>MESS. But do you think Thebes thus void of men?</p>

  <p>CHOR. Bacchus, Bacchus, not Thebes, has my allegiance.</p>

  <p>MESS. You, indeed may be pardoned; still, O woman, it is not right to
  rejoice at the misfortunes which have been brought to pass.</p>

  <p>CHOR. Tell me, say, by what fate is the wicked man doing wicked things
  dead, O man?</p>

  <p>MESS. When having left Therapnæ of this Theban land, we crossed the
  streams of Asopus, we entered on the height of Cithæron, Pentheus and I,
  for I was following my master, and the stranger who was our guide in this
  search, for the sight: first, then, we sat down in a grassy vale, keeping
  our steps and tongues in silence, that we might see, not being seen; and
  there was a valley surrounded by precipices, irrigated with streams,
  shaded around with pines, where the Mænads were sitting employing their
  hands in pleasant labors, for some of them were again crowning the
  worn-out thyrsus, so as to make it leafy with ivy; and some, like horses
  quitting the painted yoke, shouted in reply to another a Bacchic melody.
  And the miserable Pentheus, not seeing the crowd of women, spake thus: O
  stranger, where we are standing, I can not come at the place where is the
  dance of the Mænads; but climbing a mound, or pine with lofty neck, I
  could well discern the shameful deeds of the Mænads. And on this I now
  see a strange deed of the stranger; for seizing hold of the extreme lofty
  branch of a pine, he pulled it down, pulled it, pulled it to the dark
  earth, and it was bent like a bow, or as a curved wheel worked by a lathe
  describes a circle as it revolves, thus the stranger, pulling a mountain
  bough with his hands, bent it to the earth; doing no mortal's deed; and
  having placed Pentheus on the pine branches, he let it go upright through
  his hands steadily, taking care that it should not shake him off; and the
  pine stood firm upright to the sky, bearing on its back my master,
  sitting on it; and he was seen rather than saw the Mænads, for sitting on
  high he was apparent, as not before.<a name="Ba_55"></a><a
  href="#BaN_55"><sup>[55]</sup></a> And one could no longer see the
  stranger, but there was a certain voice from the sky; Bacchus, as one
  might conjecture, shouted out: O youthful women, I bring you him who made
  you and me and my orgies a laughing-stock: but punish ye him. And at the
  same time he cried out, and sent forth to heaven and earth a light of
  holy fire;<a name="Ba_56"></a><a href="#BaN_56"><sup>[56]</sup></a> and
  the air was silent, and the fair meadowed grove kept its leaves in
  silence, and you could not hear the voice of the beasts; but they not
  distinctly receiving the voice, stood upright, and cast their eyes
  around. And again he proclaimed his bidding. And when the daughters of
  Cadmus' recognized the distinct command of Bacchus, they rushed forth,
  having in the eager running of their feet a speed not less than that of a
  dove; his mother, Agave, and her kindred sisters, and all the Bacchæ: and
  frantic with the inspiration of the God, they bounded through the
  torrent-streaming valley, and the clefts. But when they saw my master
  sitting on the pine, first they threw at him handfuls of stones, striking
  his head, mounting on an opposite piled rock; and with pine branches some
  aimed, and some hurled their thyrsi through the air at Pentheus, wretched
  mark;<a name="Ba_57"></a><a href="#BaN_57"><sup>[57]</sup></a> but they
  failed of their purpose; for he having a height too great for their
  eagerness, sat, wretched, destitute through perplexity. But at last
  thundering together<a name="Ba_58"></a><a
  href="#BaN_58"><sup>[58]</sup></a> some oaken branches, they tore up the
  roots with levers not of iron; and when they could not accomplish the end
  of their labors, Agave said, Come, standing round in a circle, seize each
  a branch, O Mænads, that we may take the beast<a name="Ba_59"></a><a
  href="#BaN_59"><sup>[59]</sup></a> who has climbed aloft, that he may not
  tell abroad the secret dances of the God. And they applied their
  innumerable hands to the pine, and tore it up from the ground; and
  sitting on high, Pentheus falls to the ground from on high, with
  numberless lamentations; for he knew that he was near to ill. And first
  his mother, as the priestess, began his slaughter, and falls upon him;
  but he threw the turban from his hair, that the wretched Agave,
  recognizing him, might not slay him; and touching her cheek, he says, I,
  indeed, O mother, am thy child,<a name="Ba_60"></a><a
  href="#BaN_60"><sup>[60]</sup></a> Pentheus, whom you bore in the house
  of Echion; but pity me, O mother! and do not slay me, thy child, for my
  sins. But she, foaming and rolling her eyes every way, not thinking as
  she ought to think, was possessed by Bacchus, and he did not persuade
  her; and seizing his left hand with her hand, treading on the side of the
  unhappy man, she tore off his shoulder, not by [her own] strength, but
  the God gave facility to her hands; and Ino completed the work on the
  other side, tearing his flesh. And Autonoe and the whole crowd of the
  Bacchæ pressed on; and there was a noise of all together; he, indeed,
  groaning as much as he had life in him, and they shouted; and one bore
  his arm, another his foot, shoe and all; and his sides were bared by
  their tearings, and the whole band, with gory hands, tore to pieces the
  flesh of Pentheus: and his body lies in different places, part under the
  rugged rocks, part in the deep shade of the wood, not easy to be sought;
  and as to his miserable head, which his mother has taken in her hands,
  having fixed it on the top of a thyrsus, she is bearing it, like that of
  a savage lion, through the middle of Cithæron, leaving her sisters in the
  dances of the Mænads; and she goes along rejoicing in her unhappy prey,
  within these walls, calling upon Bacchus, her fellow-huntsman, her
  fellow-workman in the chase, of glorious victory, by which she wins a
  victory of tears. I, therefore, will depart out of the way of this
  calamity before Agave comes to the palace; but to be wise, and to
  reverence the Gods, this, I think, is the most honorable and wisest thing
  for mortals who adopt it.</p>

  <p>CHOR. Let us dance in honor of Bacchus; let us raise a shout for what
  has befallen Pentheus, the descendant of the dragon, who assumed female
  attire and the wand with the beautiful thyrsus,&mdash;a certain death,
  having a bull<a name="Ba_61"></a><a href="#BaN_61"><sup>[61]</sup></a> as
  his leader to calamity. Ye Cadmean Bacchants, ye have accomplished a
  glorious victory, illustrious, yet for woe and tears. It is a glorious
  contest to plunge one's dripping hand in the blood of one's son.
  But&mdash;for I see Agave, the mother of Pentheus, coining to the house
  with starting eyes; receive the revel of the Evian God.</p>

  <p>CHOR. And thy son Pentheus his mother&mdash;</p>

  <p>AG. &mdash;will praise, as having caught this lion-born prey.</p>

  <p>CHOR. An excellent prey.</p>

  <p>AG. Excellently.</p>

  <p>CHOR. You rejoice.</p>

  <p>AG. I rejoice greatly, having accomplished great and illustrious deeds
  for this land.</p>

  <p>CHOR. Show now, O wretched woman, thy victorious booty to the
  citizens, which you have come bringing with you.</p>

  <p>AG. O, ye who dwell in the fair-towered city of the Theban land, come
  ye, that ye may behold this prey, O daughters of Cadmus, of the wild
  beast which we have taken; not by the thonged javelins of the
  Thessalians, not by nets, but by the fingers, our white arms; then may we
  boast that we should in vain possess the instruments of the spear-makers;
  but we, with this hand, slew this beast, and tore its limbs asunder.
  Where is my aged father? let him come near; and where is my son Pentheus?
  let him take and raise the ascent of a wattled ladder against the house,
  that he may fasten to the triglyphs this head of the lion which I am
  present having caught.</p>

  <p>CAD. Follow me, bearing the miserable burden of Pentheus; follow me, O
  servants, before the house; whose body here, laboring with immeasurable
  search, I bear, having found it in the defiles of Cithæron, torn to
  pieces, and finding nothing in the same place, lying in a thicket,
  difficult to be searched. For I heard from some one of the daring deeds
  of my daughters just as I came to the city within the walls, with the old
  Tiresias, concerning the Bacchæ; and having returned again to the
  mountain, I bring back my child, slain by the Mænads. And I saw Autonoe,
  who formerly bore Actæon to Aristæus, and Ino together, still mad in the
  thicket, unhappy creatures; but some one told me that Agave was coming
  hither with frantic foot; nor did I hear a false tale, for I behold her,
  an unhappy sight.</p>

  <p>AG. O father! you may boast a great boast, that you of mortals have
  begotten by far the best daughters; I mean all, but particularly myself,
  who, leaving my shuttle at the loom, have come to greater things, to
  catch wild beasts with my hands. And having taken him, I bear in my arms,
  as you see, these spoils of my valor, that they may be suspended against
  your house. And do you, O father, receive them in your hands; and
  rejoicing over my successful capture, invite your friends to a feast; for
  you are blessed, blessed since I have done such deeds.</p>

  <p>CAD. O, woe! and not to be seen, of those who have accomplished a
  slaughter not to be measured by wretched hands; having stricken down a
  glorious victim for the Gods, you invite Thebes and me to a banquet. Alas
  me, first for thy ills, then for mine own; how justly, but how severely,
  has king Bromius destroyed us, being one of our own family!</p>

  <p>AG. How morose is old age in men! and sullen to the eye; would that my
  son may be fond of hunting, resembling the disposition of his mother,
  when with the Theban youths he would strive after the beasts&mdash;but he
  is only fit to contend with Gods. He is to be admonished, O father, by
  you and me, not to rejoice in clever evil. Where is he? Who will summon
  him hither to my sight, that he may see me, that happy woman?</p>

  <p>CAD. Alas, alas! knowing what ye have done, ye will grieve a sad
  grief; but if forever ye remain in the condition in which ye are, not
  fortunate, you will seem not to be unfortunate.</p>

  <p>AG. But what of these matters is not well, or what is grievous?</p>

  <p>CAD. First cast your eyes up to this sky.</p>

  <p>AG. Well; why do you bid me look at it?</p>

  <p>CAD. Is it still the same, or think you it is changed?</p>

  <p>AG. It is brighter than formerly, and more divine.</p>

  <p>CAD. Is then this fluttering still present to your soul?</p>

  <p>AG. I understand not your word; but I become somehow sobered, changing
  from my former mind.</p>

  <p>CAD. Can you then hear any thing, and answer clearly?</p>

  <p>AG. How I forget what we said before, O father!</p>

  <p>CAD. To what house did you come in marriage?</p>

  <p>AG. You gave me, as they say, to the sown Echion.</p>

  <p>CAD. What son then was born in your house to your husband?</p>

  <p>AG. Pentheus, by the association of myself and his father.</p>

  <p>CAD. Whose head then have you in your arms?</p>

  <p>AG. That of a lion, as those who hunted him said.</p>

  <p>CAD. Look now rightly; short is the toil to see.</p>

  <p>AG. Ah! what do I see? what is this I bear in my hands?</p>

  <p>CAD. Look at it, and learn more clearly.</p>

  <p>AG. I see the greatest grief, wretch that I am!</p>

  <p>CAD. Does it seem to you to be like a lion?</p>

  <p>AG. No: but I, wretched, hold the head of Pentheus.</p>

  <p>CAD. Ay, much lamented before you recognized him.</p>

  <p>AG. Who slew him, how came he into my hands?</p>

  <p>CAD. O wretched truth, how unseasonably art thou come!</p>

  <p>AG. Tell me, since delay causes a quivering at my heart.</p>

  <p>CAD. You and your sisters slew him.</p>

  <p>AG. And where did he die, in the house, or in what place?</p>

  <p>CAD. Where formerly the dogs tore Actæon to pieces.</p>

  <p>AG. But why did he, unhappy, go to Cithæron?</p>

  <p>CAD. He went deriding the God and your Bacchic revels.</p>

  <p>AG. But on what account did we go thither?</p>

  <p>CAD. Ye were mad, and the whole city was frantic with Bacchus.<a
  name="Ba_64"></a><a href="#BaN_64"><sup>[64]</sup></a></p>

  <p>AG. Bacchus undid us&mdash;now I perceive.</p>

  <p>CAD. Being insulted with insolence&mdash;for ye thought him not a
  God.</p>

  <p>AG. But the dear body of my child, O father!</p>

  <p>CAD. I having with difficulty traced it, bring it all.</p>

  <p>AG. What! rightly united in its joints? *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

  <p>AG. But what part had Pentheus in my folly?<a name="Ba_65"></a><a
  href="#BaN_65"><sup>[65]</sup></a></p>

  <p>CAD. He was like you, not reverencing the God, therefore he joined all
  in one ruin, both ye and this one, so as to ruin the house, and me, who
  being childless of male children, see this branch of thy womb, O unhappy
  woman! most miserably and shamefully slain&mdash;whom the house
  respected; you, O child, who supported my house, born of my daughter, and
  was an object of fear to the city; and no one wished to insult the old
  man, seeing you; for he would have received a worthy punishment. But now
  I shall be cast out of my house dishonored, I, the mighty Cadmus, who
  sowed the Theban race, and reaped a most glorious crop; O dearest of men,
  for although no longer in being, still thou shalt be counted by me as
  dearest of my children; no longer touching this, my chin, with thy hand,
  addressing me, your mother's father, wilt thou embrace me, my son,
  saying, Who injures, who insults you, O father, who harasses your heart,
  being troublesome I say, that I may punish him who does you wrong, O
  father. But now I am miserable, and thou art wretched, and thy mother is
  pitiable, and thy relations are wretched. But if there is any one who
  despises the Gods, looking on this man's death, let him acknowledge the
  Gods.</p>

  <p>CHOR. I grieve for thy state, O Cadmus; but your child has the
  punishment of your daughter, deserved indeed, but grievous to you.</p>

  <p>AG. O father, for you see how I am changed ...</p>

  <p>BAC ... changing, you shall become a dragon, and your wife becoming a
  beast, shall receive in exchange the form of a serpent, Harmonia, the
  daughter of Mars, whom you had, being a mortal. And as the oracle of Jove
  says, you shall drive with your wife a chariot of heifers, ruling over
  barbarians; and with an innumerable army you shall sack many cities; and
  when they plunder the temple of Apollo, they shall have a miserable
  return, but Mars shall defend you and Harmonia, and shall settle your
  life in the islands of the blessed. I say this, I, Bacchus, not born of a
  mortal father, but of Jove; and if ye had known how to be wise when ye
  would not, ye would have been happy, having the son of Jupiter for your
  ally.</p>

  <p>CAD. Bacchus, we beseech thee, we have erred.</p>

  <p>BAC. Ye have learned it too late; but when it behooved you, you knew
  it not.</p>

  <p>CAD. I knew it, but you press on us too severely.</p>

  <p>BAC. [Ay,] for I, being a God, was insulted by you.</p>

  <p>CAD. It is not right for Gods to resemble mortals in anger.<a
  name="Ba_66"></a><a href="#BaN_66"><sup>[66]</sup></a></p>

  <p>BAC. My father, Jove, long ago decreed this.</p>

  <p>AG. Alas! a miserable banishment is the decree<a name="Ba_67"></a><a
  href="#BaN_67"><sup>[67]</sup></a> [for us,] old man.</p>

  <p>BAC. Why do ye then delay what must needs be?</p>

  <p>CAD. O child, into what terrible evil have we come; both you wretched
  and your *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* sisters,<a name="Ba_68"></a><a
  href="#BaN_68"><sup>[68]</sup></a> and I miserable, shall go, an aged
  sojourner, to foreigners. Still it is foretold that I shall bring into
  Greece a motley barbarian army, and leading their spears, I, a dragon,
  shall lead the daughter of Mars, Harmonia, my wife, having the fierce
  nature of a dragon, to the altars and tombs of the Greeks. Nor shall I,
  wretched, rest from ills, nor even sailing over the Acheron below shall I
  be at rest.</p>

  <p>AG. O, my father! and I being deprived of you shall be banished.</p>

  <p>CAD. Why do you embrace me with your hands, O unhappy child, as a
  white swan does its exhausted<a name="Ba_69"></a><a
  href="#BaN_69"><sup>[69]</sup></a> parent?</p>

  <p>AG. For whither can I turn, cast out from my country?</p>

  <p>CAD. I know not, my child; your father is a poor ally.</p>

  <p>AG. Farewell, O house! farewell, O ancestral city! I leave you in
  misfortune a fugitive from my chamber.</p>

  <p>CAD. Go then, my child, to the land of Aristæus *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*.</p>

  <p>AG. I bemoan thee, O father!</p>

  <p>CAD. And I thee, my child; and I lament your sisters.</p>

  <p>AG. Terribly indeed has king Bacchus brought this misery upon thy
  house.</p>

  <p>BAC. [Ay,] for I have suffered terrible things from ye, having a name
  unhonored in Thebes.</p>

  <p>AG. Farewell, my father.</p>

  <p>CAD. And you farewell, O miserable daughter; yet you can not easily
  arrive at this.</p>

  <p>AG. Lead me, O guides, where I may take my miserable sisters as the
  companions of my flight; and may I go where neither accursed Cithæron may
  see me, nor I may see Cithæron with my eyes, and where there is no memory
  of the thyrsus hallowed, but they may be a care to other Bacchæ.</p>

  <p>CHOR. There are many forms of divine things; and the Gods bring to
  pass many in an unexpected manner: both what has been expected has not
  been accomplished, and God has found out a means for doing things
  unthought of. So, too, has this event turned out.<a name="Ba_70"></a><a

  designed an etymological quibble, he would probably have made some
  allusion to Merus, a mountain of India, where Bacchus is said to have
  been brought up. See Curtius, viii. 10. "Sita est sub radicibus montis,

<h3>THE ARGUMENT.</h3>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Iolaus, son of Iphiclus, and nephew of Hercules, whom he had joined in
  his expeditions during his youth, in his old age protected his sons. For
  the sons of Hercules having been driven out of every part of Greece by
  Eurystheus, he came with them to Athens; and, embracing the altars of the
  Gods, was safe, Demophoon being king of the city; and when Copreus, the
  herald of Eurystheus, wished to remove the suppliants, he prevented him.
  Upon this he departed, threatening war. Demophoon despised him; but
  hearing the oracles promise him victory if he sacrificed the most noble
  Athenian virgin to Ceres, he was grieved; not wishing to slay either his
  own daughter, or that of any citizen, for the sake of the suppliants. But
  Macaria, one of the daughters of Hercules, hearing of the prediction,
  willingly devoted herself. They honored her for her noble death, and,
  knowing that their enemies were at hand, went forth to battle. The play
  ends with their victory, and the capture of Eurystheus.</p>

<hr />

<h2>THE HERACLIDÆ.</h2>

<hr class="short" />

<p class="center">IOLAUS.</p>

  <p>This has long since been my established opinion, the just man is born
  for his neighbors; but he who has a mind bent upon gain is both useless
  to the city and disagreeable to deal with, but best for himself. And I
  know this, not having learned it by word of mouth; for I, through shame,
  and reverencing the ties of kindred, when it was in my power to dwell
  quietly in Argos, partook of more of Hercules' labors, while he was with
  us, than any one man besides:<a name="Heraclid_1"></a><a
  href="#HeraclidN_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> and now that he dwells in heaven,
  keeping these his children under my wings, I preserve them, I myself
  being in want of safety. For since their father was removed from the
  earth, first Eurystheus wished to kill me, but I escaped; and my country
  indeed is no more, but my life is saved, and I wander in exile, migrating
  from one city to another. For, in addition to my other ills, Eurystheus
  has chosen to insult me with this insult; sending heralds whenever on
  earth he learns we are settled, he demands us, and drives us out of the
  land; alleging the city of Argos, one not paltry either to be friends
  with or to make an enemy, and himself too prospering as he is; but they
  seeing my weak state, and that these too are little, and bereaved of
  their sire, respecting the more powerful, drive us from the land. And I
  am banished, together with the banished children, and fare ill together
  with those who fare ill, loathing to desert them, lest some may say thus,
  Behold, now that the children have no father, Iolaus, their kinsman born,
  defends them not. But being bereft of all Greece, coming to Marathon and
  the country under the same rule, we sit suppliants at the altars of the
  Gods, that they may assist us; for it is said that the two sons of
  Theseus inhabit the territory of this land, of the race of Pandion,
  having received it by lot, being near akin to these children; on which
  account we have come this way to the frontiers of illustrious Athens. And
  by two aged people is this flight led, I, indeed, being alarmed about
  these children; and the female race of her son Alcmena preserves within
  this temple, clasping it in her arms; for we are ashamed that virgins
  should mingle with the mob, and stand at the altars. But Hyllus and his
  brothers, who are older, are seeking where there is a strong-hold that we
  may inhabit, if we be thrust forth from this land by force. O children,
  children! hither; take hold of my garments; I see the herald of
  Eurystheus coming hither toward us, by whom we are pursued as wanderers,
  deprived of every land.<a name="Heraclid_2"></a><a
  href="#HeraclidN_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> O detested one, may you perish,
  and the man who sent you: how many evils indeed have you announced to the
  noble father of these children from that same mouth!</p>

  <p>COPREUS. I suppose you think that this is a fine seat you are sitting
  in, and have come to a city which is an ally, thinking foolishly; for
  there is no one who will choose your useless power in preference to
  Eurystheus. Depart; why toilest thou thus? You must rise up and go to
  Argos, where punishment by stoning awaits you.</p>

  <p>IOL. Not so, since the altar of the God will aid me, and the free land
  in which we tread.</p>

  <p>COP. Do you wish to cause me trouble with this band?</p>

  <p>IOL. Surely you will not drag me away, nor these children, seizing by
  force?</p>

  <p>COP. You shall know; but you are not a good prophet in this.</p>

  <p>IOL. This shall never happen, while I am alive.</p>

  <p>COP. Depart; but I will lead these away, even though you be unwilling,
  considering them, wherever they may be, to belong to Eurystheus.</p>

  <p>IOL. O ye who have dwelt in Athens a long time, defend us; for, being
  suppliants of Jove, the Presider over the Forum,<a
  name="Heraclid_3"></a><a href="#HeraclidN_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> we are
  treated with violence, and our garlands are profaned, both a reproach to
  the city, and an insult to the Gods.</p>

  <p>CHORUS. Hollo! hollo! what is this noise near the altar? what calamity
  will it straightway portend?</p>

  <p>IOL. Behold me, a weak old man, thrown down on the plain; miserable
  that I am.</p>

  <p>CHOR. By whose hand do you fall this unhappy fall?</p>

 *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*

  <p>IOL. This man, O strangers, dishonoring your Gods, drags me violently
  from the altar of Jupiter.</p>

  <p>CHOR. From what land, O old man, have you come hither to this people
  dwelling together in four cities?<a name="Heraclid_4"></a><a
  href="#HeraclidN_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> or, have you come hither from
  across [the sea] with marine oar, having quitted the Eub&#339;an
  shore?</p>

  <p>IOL. O strangers, I am not accustomed to an islander's life, but we
  are come to your land from Mycenæ.</p>

  <p>CHOR. What name, O old man, did the Mycenæan people call you?</p>

  <p>IOL. Know that I am lolaus, once the companion of Hercules; for this
  body is not unrenowned.</p>

  <p>CHOR. I know, having heard of it before; but say whose youthful
  children you are leading in your hand.</p>

  <p>IOL. These, O strangers, are the sons of Hercules, who are come as
  suppliants of you and the city.</p>

  <p>CHOR. What do ye seek? or, tell me, is it wanting to have speech of
  the city?</p>

  <p>IOL. Not to be given up, and not to go to Argos, being dragged from
  your Gods by force.</p>

  <p>COP. But this will not be sufficient for your masters, who, having
  power over you, find you here.</p>

  <p>CHOR. It is right, O stranger, to reverence the suppliants of the
  Gods, and not for you to leave by violent hands the habitations of the
  deities, for venerable Justice will not suffer this.</p>

  <p>COP. Send now Eurystheus's subjects out of this land, and I will not
  use this hand violently.</p>

  <p>CHOR. It is impious for a state to reject the suppliant prayer of
  strangers.</p>

  <p>COP. But it is good to have one's foot out of trouble, being possessed
  of the better counsel.</p>

  <p>CHOR. You should then have dared this, having spoken to the king of
  this land, but you should not drag strangers away from the Gods by force,
  if you respect a free land.</p>

  <p>COP. But who is king of this country and city?</p>

  <p>CHOR. Demophoon, the son of Theseus, of a noble father.</p>

  <p>COP. With him, then, the contest of this argument had best be; all
  else is spoken in vain.</p>

  <p>CHOR. And indeed hither he comes in haste, and Acamas, his brother, to
  hear these words.</p>

  <p>DEMOPHOON. Since you, being an old man, have anticipated us, who are
  younger, in running to this hearth of Jove, say what hap collects this
  multitude here.</p>

  <p>CHOR. These sons of Hercules sit here as suppliants, having crowned
  the altar, as you see. O king, and Iolaus, the faithful companion of
  their father.</p>

  <p>DE. Why then did this chance occasion clamors?</p>

  <p>CHOR. This man caused the noise, seeking to lead him by force from
  this hearth; and he tripped up the legs of the old man, so that I shed
  the tear for pity.</p>

  <p>DE. And indeed he has a Grecian robe and style of dress; but these are
  the doings of a barbarian hand; it is for you then to tell me, and not to
  delay, leaving the confines of what land you are come hither.</p>

  <p>COP. I am an Argive; for this you wish to learn: and I am willing to
  say why, and from whom, I am come. Eurystheus, the king of Mycenæ, sends
  me hither to lead away these men; and I have come, O stranger, having
  many just things at once to do and to say; for I being an Argive myself,
  lead away Argives, having them as fugitives from my country condemned to
  die by the laws there; and we have the right, managing our city ourselves
  by ourselves, to fix our own punishments: but they having come to the
  hearths of many others also, there also we have taken our stand on these
  same arguments, and no one has dared to bring evils upon himself. But
  either perceiving some folly in you, they have come hither, or in
  perplexity running the risk, whether it shall be or not. For surely they
  do not think that you alone are mad, in so great a portion of Greece as
  they have been over, so as to commiserate their foolish distresses. Come,
  compare the two; admitting them into your land, and suffering us to lead
  them away, what will you gain? Such things as these you may gain from us;
  you may add to this city the whole power of Argos, and all the might of
  Eurystheus; but if looking to the words and pitiable condition of these
  men, you are softened by them, the matter comes to the contest of the
  spear; for think not that we will give up this contest without steel.
  What then will you say? deprived of what lands, making war with the
  Tirynthians and Argives, and repelling them, with what allies, and on
  whose behalf will you bury the dead that fall? Surely you will obtain an
  evil report among the citizens, if, for the sake of an old man, a mere
  tomb,<a name="Heraclid_5"></a><a href="#HeraclidN_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a>
  one who is nothing, as one may say, and of these children, you will put
  your foot into a mess;<a name="Heraclid_6"></a><a
  href="#HeraclidN_6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> you will say, at best, that you
  shall find, at least, hope; and this too is at present much wanting; for
  these who are armed would fight but ill with Argives if they were grown
  up, if this encourages your mind, and there is much time in the mean
  while in which ye may be destroyed; but be persuaded by me, giving
  nothing, but permitting me to lead away my own, gain Mycenæ. And do not
  (as you are wont to do) suffer this, when it is in your power to choose
  the better friends, choose the worse.</p>

  <p>CHOR. Who can decide what is right, or understand an argument, till he
  has clearly heard the statement of both?</p>

  <p>IOL. O king, this exists in thy city; I am permitted in turn to speak
  and to hear, and no one will reject me before that, as in other places;
  but with this man we have nothing to do; for since nothing of Argos is
  any longer ours, (it having been decreed by a vote,) but we are exiled
  our country, how can this man justly lead us away as Mycenæans, whom they
  have driven from the land? for we are strangers; or else you decide that
  whoever is banished Argos is banished the boundaries of the Greeks.
  Surely not from Athens; they will not, for fear of the Argives, drive out
  the children of Hercules from their land; for it is not Trachis, nor the
  Achæan city, from whence you, not by justice, but bragging about Argos;
  just as you now speak, drove these men, sitting at the altars as
  suppliants; for if this shall be, and they ratify your words, I no longer
  know this Athens as free. But I know their disposition and nature; they
  will rather die; for among virtuous men, disgrace is considered before
  life. Enough of the city; for indeed it is an invidious thing to praise
  it too much; and often I know myself I have been oppressed at being
  overpraised: but I wish to say to you that it is necessary for you to
  save these men, since you are ruler over this land. Pittheus was son of
  Pelops and Æthra, daughter of Pittheus, and your father Theseus was born
  of her. And again I trace for you their descent: Hercules was son of
  Jupiter and Alcmena, and she was the child of the daughter of Pelops; so
  your father and theirs must be fellow-cousins. Thus you, O Demophoon, are
  related to them by birth; and, besides this connection, I will tell you
  for what you are bound to requite the children. For I say, I formerly,
  when shield-bearer to their father, sailed with Theseus after the belt,<a
  name="Heraclid_7"></a><a href="#HeraclidN_7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> the cause
  of much slaughter, and from the murky recesses of hell did he bring forth
  your father. All Greece bears witness to this; for which things they
  beseech you to return a kindness, and that they may not be yielded up,
  nor be driven from this land, torn from your Gods by violence; for this
  would be disgraceful to you by yourself, and an evil to the city,<a
  name="Heraclid_8"></a><a href="#HeraclidN_8"><sup>[8]</sup></a> that
  suppliant relations, wanderers&mdash;alas for the misery! look on them,
  look&mdash;should be dragged away by force. But I beseech you, and offer
  you suppliant garlands, by your hands and your chin, do not dishonor the
  children of Hercules, having received them in your power; but be thou a
  relation to them, be a friend, father, brother, master; for all these
  things are better than [for them] to fall into the power of the
  Argives.</p>

  <p>CHOR. Hearing of these men's misfortunes, I pitied them, O king! and
  now particularly I have witnessed nobleness overcome by fortune; for
  these men, being sons of a noble father, are undeservedly unhappy.</p>

  <p>DE. Three ways of misfortune urge me, O Iolaus, not to reject these
  suppliants. The greatest, Jupiter, at whose altars you sit, having this
  procession of youths with you; and my relationship to them, and because I
  am bound of old that they should fare well at my hands, in gratitude to
  their father; and the disgrace,<a name="Heraclid_9"></a><a
  href="#HeraclidN_9"><sup>[9]</sup></a> which one ought exceedingly to
  regard. For if I permitted this altar to be violated by force by a
  strange man, I shall not seem to inhabit a free country. But I fear to
  betray my suppliants to the Argives; and this is nearly as bad as the
  noose. But I wish you had come with better fortune; but still, even now,
  fear not that any one shall drag you and these children by force from
  this altar. And do thou, going to Argos, both tell this to Eurystheus;
  and besides that, if he has any charge against these strangers, he shall
  meet with justice; but you shall never drag away these men.</p>

  <p>COP. Not if it be just, and I prevail in argument?</p>

  <p>DE. And how can it be just to drag away a suppliant by force?</p>

  <p>COP. This, then, is not disgraceful to me, but an injury to you.</p>

  <p>DE. To me indeed, if I allow you to drag them away.</p>

  <p>COP. But do you depart, and then will I drag them thence.</p>

  <p>DE. You are stupid, thinking yourself wiser than a God.</p>

  <p>COP. Hither it seems the wicked should fly.</p>

  <p>DE. The seat of the Gods is a common defense to all.</p>

  <p>COP. Perhaps this will not seem good to the Mycenæans.</p>

  <p>DE. Am not I then master over those here?</p>

  <p>COP. [Ay,] but not to injure them, if you are wise.</p>

  <p>DE. Are ye hurt, if I do not defile the Gods?</p>

  <p>COP. I do not wish you to have war with the Argives.</p>

  <p>DE. I, too, am the same; but I will not let go of these men.</p>

  <p>COP. At all events, taking possession of my own, I shall lead them
  away.</p>

  <p>DE. Then you will not easily depart back to Argos.</p>

  <p>COP. I shall soon see that by experience.</p>

  <p>DE. You will touch them to your own injury, and that without
  delay.</p>

  <p>CHOR. For God's sake, venture not to strike a herald!</p>

  <p>DE. I will not, if the herald at least will learn to be wise.</p>

  <p>CHOR. Depart thou; and do not you touch him, O king!</p>

  <p>COP. I go; for the struggle of a single hand is powerless. But I will
  come, bringing hither many a brazen spear of Argive war; and ten thousand
  shield-bearers await me, and Eurystheus, the king himself, as general.
  And he waits, expecting news from hence, on the extreme confines of
  Alcathus; and, having heard of your insolence, he will make himself too
  well known to you, and to the citizens, and to this land, and to the
  trees; for in vain should we have so much youth in Argos, if we did not
  chastise you.</p>

  <p>DE. Destruction on you! for I do not fear your Argos. But you are not
  likely, insulting me, to drag these men away from hence by force; for I
  possess this land, not being subject to that of Argos, but free.</p>

  <p>CHOR. It is time to provide, before the army of the Argives approaches
  the borders. And very impetuous is the Mars of the Mycenæans, and on this
  account more than before; for it is the habit of all heralds to tower up
  what is twice as much. What do you not think he will say to his princes
  about what terrible things he has suffered, and how within a little he
  was losing his life.</p>

  <p>IOL. There is not, to this man's children, a more glorious honor than
  to be sprung from a good and valiant father, and to marry from a good
  family; but I will not praise him who, overcome by desire, has mingled
  with the vulgar, to leave his children a reproach instead of pleasure;
  for noble birth wards off misfortune better than low descent; for we,
  having fallen into the extremity of evils, find these men friends and
  relations, who alone, in so large a country as Greece, have stood forward
  [on our behalf.] Give, O children, give them your right hand; and do ye
  give yours to the children, and draw near to them. O children, we have
  come to experience of our friends; and if you ever have a return to your
  country, and [again] possess the homes and honors of your father, always
  consider them your saviors and friends, and never lift the hostile spear
  against the land, remembering these things; but consider it the dearest
  city of all. And they are worthy that you should revere them, who have
  chosen to have so great a country and the Pelasgic people as enemies
  instead of us, though seeing us to be beggared wanderers; but still they
  have not given us up, nor driven us from their land. But I, living and
  dying, when I do die, with much praise, my friend, will extol you when I
  am in company with Theseus; and telling this, I will delight him, saying
  how well you received and aided the children of Hercules; and, being
  noble, you preserve through Greece your ancestral glory; and being born
  of noble parents, you are nowise inferior to your father, with but few
  others; for among many you may find perhaps but one who is not inferior
  to his father.<a name="Heraclid_10"></a><a
  href="#HeraclidN_10"><sup>[10]</sup></a></p>

  <p>CHOR. This land is ever willing to aid in a just cause those in
  difficulty; therefore it has borne numberless toils for its friends, and
  now I see this contest at hand.</p>

  <p>DE. Thou hast spoken well; and I boast, old man, that their
  disposition is such that the kindness will be remembered. And I will make
  an assembly of the citizens, and draw them up so as to receive the army
  of the Mycenæans with a large force. First, I will send spies toward it,
  that it may not fall upon me by surprise: for in Argos every warrior is
  eager to run to assistance. And having collected the soothsayers, I will
  sacrifice. And do you go to my palace with the children, leaving the
  hearth of Jove, for there are those who, even if I be from home, will
  take care of you; go then, old man, to my palace.</p>

  <p>IOL. I will not leave the altar; but we will sit here, as suppliants,
  waiting till the city is successful; and when you are well freed from
  this contest, we will go to thy palace. But we have Gods as allies not
  inferior to those of the Argives, O king; for Juno, the wife of Jove, is
  their champion, but Minerva ours; and I say that this also tends to
  success, to have the best Gods, for Pallas will not endure to be
  conquered.</p>

  <p>CHOR. If thou boastest greatly, others do not therefore care for thee
  the more, O stranger, coming from Argos; but with thy big words thou wilt
  not terrify my mind: may it not be so to the mighty Athens, with the
  beauteous dances. But both thou art foolish, the son of Sthenelus, king
  in Argos, who, coming to another city not less than Argos, being a
  stranger, seek by violence to lead away wanderers, suppliants of the
  Gods, and claiming the protection of my land, not yielding to our kings,
  nor saying any thing else that is just. How can this be thought well
  among the wise? Peace indeed pleases me; but, O foolish king, I tell
  thee, if thou comest to this city, thou wilt not thus obtain what thou
  thinkest for. You are not the only one who has a spear and a brazen
  shield; but, O lover of war, mayest thou not with the spear disturb my
  city dear to the Graces; but restrain thyself.</p>

  <p>IOL. O my son, why comest thou, bringing solicitude to my eyes? Hast
  thou any news of the enemy? Do they delay, or are they at hand I or what
  do you hear? for I fear the word of the herald will in no wise be false,
  for their leader will come, having been fortunate in previous affairs, I
  clearly know, and with no moderate pride, against Athens; but Jove is the
  chastiser of over-arrogant thoughts.<a name="Heraclid_11"></a><a
  href="#HeraclidN_11"><sup>[11]</sup></a></p>

  <p>DE. The army of the Argives is coming, and Eurystheus the king. I have
  seen it myself;<a name="Heraclid_12"></a><a
  href="#HeraclidN_12"><sup>[12]</sup></a> for it behooves a man who says
  he knows well the duty of a general not to reconnoitre the enemy by means
  of messengers. He has not then, as yet, let loose his army on these
  plains, but, sitting on a lofty crag, he reconnoitres (I should tell thee
  this as a conjecture) to see by which way he shall now lead his
  expedition, and place it in a safe station in this land; and my
  preparations are already well arranged, and the city is in arms, and the
  victims stand ready for those Gods to whom they ought to be slain
  offered; and the city, by means of soothsayers, is preparing by
  sacrifices flight for the enemy and safety for the city.<a
  name="Heraclid_13"></a><a href="#HeraclidN_13"><sup>[13]</sup></a> And
  having collected together all the bards who proclaim oracles, I have
  tested the ancient oracles, both public and concealed, which might save
  this land; and in their other counsels many things are different; but one
  opinion of all is conspicuously the same, they command me to sacrifice to
  the daughter of Ceres a damsel who is of a noble father.<a
  name="Heraclid_14"></a><a href="#HeraclidN_14"><sup>[14]</sup></a> And I
  have indeed, as you see, such great good-will toward you, but I will
  neither slay my own child<a name="Heraclid_15"></a><a
  href="#HeraclidN_15"><sup>[15]</sup></a> nor compel any other of my
  citizens to do so unwillingly; and who is so mad of his own accord, as to
  give out of his hands his dearest children? And now you may see bitter
  meetings; some saying that it is right to aid foreign suppliants, and
  some blaming my folly; and if I do this, a civil war is at once prepared.
  This, then, do you consider, and devise how both you yourselves may be
  saved and this land, and I be not brought into ill odor with the
  citizens; for I have not absolute sovereignty, as over barbarians; but if
  I do just things, I shall receive just things.</p>

  <p>CHOR. But does not the Goddess allow this city, although eager, to aid
  strangers?</p>

  <p>IOL. O children, we are like sailors, who, fleeing from the fierce
  rage of the storm, have come close to land, and then, again, by gales
  from the land, have been driven again out to sea; thus also shall we be
  driven from this land, being already on shore, as if saved. Alas! why, O
  wretched hope, did you then delight me, not being about to perfect my
  joy? For his thoughts, in truth, are to be pardoned if he is not willing
  to slay the children of his citizens; and I acquiesce in their conduct
  here, if the Gods decree that I shall fare thus. My gratitude to you
  shall never perish. O children, I know not what to do with you: whither
  shall we turn? for who of the Gods has been uncrowned by us? and what
  bulwark of land have we not approachedl? We shall perish, my children, we
  shall be given up; and for myself I care nothing if it behooves me to
  die, except that, dying, I shall gratify my enemies; but I weep for and
  pity you, O children, and Alcmena, the aged mother of your father; O!
  unhappy art thou, because of thy long life; and miserable am I, having
  labored much in vain. It was our fate then, our fate, falling into the
  hands of an enemy, to leave life disgracefully and miserably. But do you
  know in what you may aid me? for all hope of their safety has not
  deserted me. Give me up to the Argives instead of them, O king, and so
  neither run any risk yourself, and let the children be saved for me; I
  must not love my own life, let it go; and above all, Eurystheus would
  like taking me, the ally of Hercules, to insult me; for he is a froward
  man; and the wise should pray to have enmity with a wise man, not with an
  ignorant disposition, for in that case one, even if unfortunate, may meet
  with much respect.</p>

  <p>CHOR. O old man, do not now blame the city, perhaps it might be a gain
  to us; but still it would be an evil reproach that we betrayed
  strangers,</p>

  <p>DE. You have spoken things noble indeed, but impossible; the king does
  not lead his army hither wanting you; for what profit were it to
  Eurystheus for an old man to die? but he wishes to slay these children;
  for noble youths, who remember their fathers' injuries, springing up, are
  terrible to enemies; all which he must needs foresee; but if you know any
  other more seasonable counsel, prepare it, since I am perplexed and full
  of fear, having heard the oracle.</p>

  <p>MACARIA. O strangers, do not impute boldness to me because of my
  advances,<a name="Heraclid_16"></a><a
  href="#HeraclidN_16"><sup>[16]</sup></a> this I will beg first; for
  silence and modesty are best for a woman, and to remain quietly in-doors;
  but, having heard your lamentations, O Iolaus, I have come forth, not
  being commissioned to act as embassador for my race, but I am in some
  wise fit to do so; but chiefly do I care for these, my brothers:
  concerning myself I wish to ask whether, besides our former evils, any
  additional distress gnaws your mind?</p>

  <p>IOL. O daughter, it is not a new thing that I justly have to praise
  you most of the children of Hercules; but our house having appeared to us
  to progress well, has again changed to perplexity, for this man says,
  that the deliverers of oracles order us to sacrifice not a bull or a
  heifer, but a virgin, who is of a noble father, if we and this city would
  exist. About this then we are perplexed, for this man says he will
  neither slay his own children nor those of any one else; and to me he
  says, not plainly indeed, but somehow or other, unless I can devise any
  remedy for this, that we must find some other land, but he himself wishes
  to preserve this country.</p>

  <p>MAC. On this condition can we then be saved?</p>

  <p>IOL. On this, being fortunate in other respects.</p>

  <p>MAC. Fear not then any longer the hostile spear of the Argives; for I
  myself, old man, before I am commanded, am prepared to die, and to stand
  for slaughter; for what shall we say if the city thinks fit for our sakes
  to encounter a great danger, but we putting toils on others, avoid death
  when we can be saved? Not so, since this would be ridiculous for
  suppliants sitting at the shrines of the Gods to mourn, but being of such
  a sire as we are, to be seen to be cowards; how can this seem good! it
  were more noble, I think, (which may it never happen!) to fall into the
  hands of the enemy, this city being taken, and afterward, being born of a
  noble father, having suffered dreadful things, to see Hades none the
  less; but shall I wander about, driven from this land, and shall I not
  indeed be ashamed if any one says, "Why have ye come hither with your
  suppliant branches, yourselves being too fond of life! Depart from the
  land, for we will not aid cowards." But neither, indeed, if these die,
  and I myself am saved, have I any hope to fare well; for before now many
  have in this way betrayed their friends. For who would choose to have me,
  a solitary damsel, for his wife, or to raise children from me? therefore
  it is better to die than to have such an unworthy fate as this; and this
  may even be more seemly for some other, who is not illustrious as I. Lead
  me then where this body must needs die, and crown me and begin the rites,
  if you think fit, and conquer your enemies; for this life is ready for
  you, willing, and not unwilling; and I promise to die for these my
  brethren, and for myself; for not caring for life, I have found this most
  glorious thing to find, namely, to leave life gloriously.</p>

  <p>CHOR. Alas! alas! what shall I say, hearing this noble speech of the
  maiden who is willing to die on behalf of her brothers? Who can utter
  more noble words than these I who of men can do [a greater deed?]<a
  name="Heraclid_17"></a><a href="#HeraclidN_17"><sup>[17]</sup></a></p>

  <p>IOL. My child, your head comes from no other source, but thou, the
  seed of a divine mind, art sprung from Hercules.<a
  name="Heraclid_18"></a><a href="#HeraclidN_18"><sup>[18]</sup></a> I am
  not ashamed at your words, but I am grieved for your fortune; but how it
  may be more justly done, I will say: we must call hither all her sisters,
  and then let her who draws the lot die for her family; but it is not
  right for thee to die without casting lots.</p>

  <p>MAC. I will not die, obtaining the lot by chance, for then there are
  no thanks [to me;]&mdash;speak it not, old man; but if you accept me, and
  are willing to use me willing, I readily give up my life to them, but
  not, being compelled.</p>

  <p>IOL. Alas! this word of thine is again nobler than the former, and
  that other was most excellent; but you surpass daring by daring, and
  [good] words by good words. I do not bid you, nor do I forbid you, to
  die, my child; but you will benefit your brothers by dying.</p>

  <p>MAC. Thou biddest wisely; fear not to partake of my pollution, but I
  shall die freely. But follow me, O old man; for I wish to die by your
  hand; and do you, being present, wrap my body in my garments, since I am
  going to the terror of sacrifice, because I am born of the father of whom
  I boast to be.</p>

  <p>IOL. I could not be present at your death.</p>

  <p>MAC. At least, then, entreat of him that I may die, not by the hands
  of men, but of women.</p>

  <p>CHOR. It shall be so, O hapless virgin; since it were disgraceful to
  me too not to deck thee honorably on many accounts; both for your valiant
  spirit, and for justice' sake: but you are the most unhappy of all women
  that I have beheld with mine eyes; but, if thou wilt, depart, bespeaking
  a last address to these and to the old man.</p>

  <p>MAC. Farewell, old man, farewell; and train up for me these children
  to be such as thyself, wise in all respects, nothing more, for they will
  suffice; and endeavor to save them, not being over-willing to die. We are
  your children; by your hands we were brought up, and behold see me
  yielding up my nuptial hour, dying for them. And ye, my company of
  brothers now present, may ye be happy, and may every thing be yours, for
  the sake of which my soul is sacrificed; and honor the old man, and the
  old woman in the house, Alcmena, the mother of my father, and these
  strangers. And if a release from troubles, and a return should ever be
  found for you through the Gods, remember to bury her who saves you, as is
  fitting; most honorably were just, for I was not wanting to you, but died
  for my race. This is my heir-loom instead of children and virginity, if
  indeed there be aught under the earth. May there indeed be nothing; for
  if we, mortals who die, are to have cares even there, I know not where
  one can turn, for to die is considered the greatest remedy for evils.</p>

  <p>IOL. But, O you, who mightily surpass all women in courage, know that,
  both living and dying, you shall be most honored by us: and farewell; for
  I abhor to speak words of ill omen about the Goddess to whom your body is
  given as the first-fruits, the daughter of Ceres. O children, we are
  undone; my limbs are relaxed by grief; take me, and place me in my seat,
  veiling me there with these garments, O children; since neither am I
  pleased at these things which are done, and if the oracle were not
  fulfilled, life would be unbearable, for the ruin would be greater; but
  even this is a calamity.</p>

  <p>CHOR. I say that no man is either happy or miserable but through the
  Gods, and that the same family does not always walk in good fortune, but
  different fates pursue it different ways; it is wont to make one from a
  lofty station insignificant, and makes the wanderer wealthy: but it is
  impossible to avoid what is fated; no one can repel it by wisdom, but he
  who is hasty without purpose will always have trouble; but do not thus
  bear the fortune sent by the Gods, falling down [in prayer,] and do not
  over-pain your mind with grief, for she hapless possesses a glorious
  portion of death on behalf of her brethren and her country; nor will an
  inglorious reputation among men await her: but virtue proceeds through
  toils. These things are worthy of her father, and worthy of her noble
  descent; and if you respect the deaths of the good, I share your
  feelings.</p>

  <p>SERVANT. O children, hail! But at what distance from this place is the
  aged Iolaus and your father's mother?</p>

  does any herald, coming from Argos, again do you violence? my strength
  indeed is weak, but thus much you must know, O stranger, you shall never
  drag these away while I am living, else may I no longer be thought to be
  his mother; but if you touch them with your hand, you will have no
  honorable contest with two old people.</p>

  from appearing hither with you, and delighting my mind?</p>

  bringing.</p>

  <p>ALC. I no longer understand this speech.</p>

  <p>IOL. I do; but it is my business to inquire about this.</p>

  <p>SERV. What then of what has been done do you wish to learn?</p>

  <p>IOL. With how great a multitude of allies is he come?</p>

  <p>SERV. With many; but I can say no other number.</p>

  <p>IOL. The chiefs of the Athenians know, I suppose.</p>

  <p>SERV. So that the general can be distinctly seen.</p>

  <p>IOL. Doing what? arraying the ranks of the enemies?</p>

  <p>SERV. We conjectured this, for we did not hear him; but I will go; I
  should not like my masters to join battle with the enemy, deserted as far
  as my part is concerned.</p>

  <p>IOL. And I will go with you; for we think the same things, being
  present to aid our friends as much as we can.</p>

  <p>SERV. It is not your part to say a foolish word.</p>

  <p>IOL. And not to share the sturdy battle with my friends!</p>

  <p>SERV. One can not see a wound from an inactive hand.</p>

  <p>IOL. But what, can not I too strike through a shield?</p>

  <p>SERV. You might strike, but you yourself would fall first.</p>

  <p>IOL. No one of the enemy will dare to behold me.</p>

  <p>SERV. You have not, my good friend, the strength which once you
  had.</p>

  numbers.</p>

  <p>SERV. You add but a slight weight to your friends.</p>

  advise.</p>

  <p>SERV. How then will you appear to the soldiers without arms?</p>

  <p>IOL. There are within this palace arms taken in war, which I will use
  and restore if alive; but the God will not demand them back of me, if I
  fall; but go in, and taking them down from the pegs, bring me as quickly
  as possible the panoply of a warrior; for this is a disgraceful
  house-keeping, for some to fight, and some to remain behind through
  fear.</p>

  <p>CHOR. Time does not depress your spirit, but it grows young again, but
  your body is weak: why dost thou toil in vain? which will harm you
  indeed, but profit our city but little; you should consider your age, and
  leave alone impossibilities, it can not be that you again should acquire
  youth.</p>

  <p>ALC. Why are you, not being in your senses, about to leave me alone
  with my children?</p>

  them.</p>

  <p>ALC. But what if you die? how shall I be saved?</p>

  <p>IOL. Your sons who are left will take care of your son.</p>

  <p>ALC. But if they, which Heaven forbid, should meet with fate!</p>

  <p>IOL. These strangers will not betray you, do not fear.</p>

  <p>ALC. Such confidence indeed I have, nothing else.</p>

  <p>IOL. And Jove, I well know, cares for your toils.</p>

  <p>ALC. Alas! Jupiter shall never be reproached by me, but he himself
  knows whether he is just toward me.</p>

  <p>SERV. You see now this panoply of arms; but you can not make too much
  haste<a name="Heraclid_22"></a><a
  href="#HeraclidN_22"><sup>[22]</sup></a> in arraying your body in them,
  as the contest is at hand, and, above all things, Mars hates those who
  delay; but if you fear the weight of arms, now then go forth unarmed,<a
  name="Heraclid_23"></a><a href="#HeraclidN_23"><sup>[23]</sup></a> and in
  the ranks be clad with this equipment, and I will carry it so far.</p>

  <p>IOL. Thou hast said well; but bring the arms, having them close at
  hand, and put a spear in my hand, and support my left arm guiding my
  foot.</p>

  <p>SERV. Is it right to lead a warrior like a child?</p>

  <p>IOL. One must go safely for the sake of the omen.</p>

  <p>SERV. Would you were able to do as much as you are willing.</p>

  <p>IOL. Make haste, I shall suffer sadly if too late for the battle.</p>

  <p>SERV. It is you who delay, and not I, seeming to do something.</p>

  <p>IOL. Do you not see how my foot presses on?</p>

  <p>SERV. I see you rather seeming to hasten than hastening.</p>

  <p>IOL. You will not say so, when you behold me there.</p>

  <p>SERV. Doing what? I wish I may see you successful.</p>

  <p>IOL. Striking some of the enemy through the shield.</p>

  <p>SERV. If indeed we get there; for that I have fears of.</p>

  <p>IOL. Alas! O arm, would thou wert such an ally to me as I recollect
  you in your youth, when you ravaged Sparta with Hercules, how would I put
  Eurystheus to flight; since he is but a coward in abiding a spear. But in
  prosperity then is this too which is not right, a reputation for courage;
  for we think that he who is prosperous knows all things well.</p>

  <p>CHOR. O earth, and moon that shinest through the night, and most
  brilliant rays of the God, that gave light to mortals, bring me news, and
  shout in heaven and at the queenly throne of the blue-eyed Minerva. I am
  about, on behalf of my country, on behalf of my house, having received
  suppliants I am about to cut through danger with the white steel. It is
  terrible that a city, prosperous as Mycenæ, and much praised for valor in
  war, should nourish secret<a name="Heraclid_24"></a><a
  href="#HeraclidN_24"><sup>[24]</sup></a> anger against my land; but it is
  evil too, O city, if we are to give up strangers at the bidding of
  Argos.<a name="Heraclid_25"></a><a
  href="#HeraclidN_25"><sup>[25]</sup></a> Jupiter is my ally, I fear not;
  Jupiter rightly has favor toward me. Never shall the Gods seem inferior
  to men in my opinion.<a name="Heraclid_26"></a><a
  href="#HeraclidN_26"><sup>[26]</sup></a> But, O venerable Goddess, for
  the soil of this land is thine, and the city of which you are mother,
  mistress, and guardian, lead away by some other way him who unjustly
  leads on this spear-brandishing host from Argos; for as far as my virtue
  is concerned, I do not deserve to be banished from these halls. For
  honor, with much sacrifice, is ever offered to you; nor does the waning<a
  name="Heraclid_27"></a><a href="#HeraclidN_27"><sup>[27]</sup></a> day of
  the month forget you, nor the songs of youths, nor the measures of
  dances; but on the lofty hill shouts resound in accordance with the
  beatings of the feet of virgins the livelong night.</p>

  <p>SERV. O mistress, I bring news most concise for you to hear, and to
  myself most glorious; we have conquered our enemies, and trophies are set
  up bearing the panoply of your enemies.</p>

  <p>ALC. O best beloved, this day has caused thee to be made free for this
  thy news; but from one disaster you do not yet free me, for I fear
  whether they be living to me whom I wish to be.</p>

  <p>SERV. They live, the most glorious in the army.</p>

  <p>ALC. Does not the aged Iolaus survive?</p>

  <p>SERV. Surely, and having done most glorious deeds by help of the
  Gods.</p>

  <p>ALC. But what? has he done any doughty act in the fight?</p>

  <p>SERV. He has changed from an old into a young man again.</p>

  <p>ALC. Thou tellest marvelous things, but first I wish you to relate the
  prosperous contest of your friends in battle.</p>

  <p>SERV. One speech of mine shall tell you all this; for when stretching
  out [our ranks] face to face, we arrayed our armies against one another,
  Hyllus putting his foot out of his four-horse chariot, stood in the
  mid-space of the field;<a name="Heraclid_28"></a><a
  href="#HeraclidN_28"><sup>[28]</sup></a> and then said, O general, you
  are come from Argos, why leave we not this land alone? and you will do
  Mycenæ no harm, depriving it of one man; but you fighting alone with me
  alone, either killing me, lead away the children of Hercules, or dying,
  allow me to possess my ancestral prerogative and palaces. And the army
  gave praise; that the speech was well spoken for a termination of their
  toils, and in respect of courage. But he neither regarding those who had
  heard the speech, nor, although he was general, his [own character for]
  cowardice, ventured not to come near the warlike spear, but was most
  cowardly; and being such, he came to enslave the descendants of Hercules.
  Hyllus then returned again back to his ranks; but the soothsayers, when
  they saw that the affair could not be arranged by single combat of one
  shield, sacrificed, and delayed not, but let fall forth immediately the
  propitious slaughter of mortal throats; and some mounted chariots, and
  some concealed their sides under the sides of their shields; but the king
  of the Athenians gave to his army such orders as become a high-born man.
  "O fellow-citizens, now it behooves one to defend the land that has
  produced and cherished us."<a name="Heraclid_29"></a><a
  href="#HeraclidN_29"><sup>[29]</sup></a> And the other also besought his
  allies not to disgrace Argos and Mycenæ. But when the signal was sounded
  on a Tyrrhenian trumpet, and they joined battle with one another, what a
  clash of spears dost thou think sounded, how great a groaning and
  lamentation at the same time! And first the dashing on of the Argive
  spear broke us; then they again retreated; and next foot being
  interchanged with foot, and man standing against man, the battle waged
  fierce; and many fell; and there were two cries, O ye who [dwell in]
  Athens, O ye who sow the land of the Argives, will ye not avert disgrace
  from the city? And with difficulty doing every thing, not without toils
  did we put the Argive force to flight; and then the old man, seeing
  Hyllus rushing on, Iolaus, stretching forth his right hand, besought him
  to place him on the horse-chariot; and seizing the reins in his hands, he
  pressed hard upon the horses of Eurystheus. And what happened after this
  I must tell by having heard from others, I myself hitherto having seen
  all; for passing by the venerable hill of the divine Minerva of Pellene,
  seeing the chariot of Eurystheus, he prayed to Juno and Jupiter to be
  young for one day, and to work vengeance on his enemies. But you have a
  marvel to hear; for two stars standing on the horse-chariot, concealed
  the chariot in a dim cloud, the wiser men say it was thy son and Hebe;
  but he from the obscure darkness showed forth a youthful image of
  youthful arms. And the glorious Iolaus takes the four-horse chariot of
  Eurystheus at the Scironian rocks&mdash;and having bound his hands in
  fetters, he comes bringing as glorious first-fruits of victory, the
  general, him who before was prosperous; but by his present fortune he
  proclaims clearly to all mortals to learn not to envy him who seems
  prosperous, till one sees him dead, as fortune is but for the day.</p>

  <p>CHOR. O Jupiter, thou turner to flight, now is it mine to behold a day
  free from dreadful fear.</p>

  <p>ALC. O Jupiter, at length you have looked upon my miseries, but still
  I thank you for what has been done: and I, who formerly did not think
  that my son dwelt with the Gods, now clearly know it. O children, now
  indeed you shall be free from toils, and free from Eurystheus, who shall
  perish miserably; and ye shall see the city of your sire, and you shall
  tread on your inheritance of land; and ye shall sacrifice to your
  ancestral gods, debarred from whom ye have had, as strangers, a wandering
  miserable life. But devising what clever thing has Iolaus spared
  Eurystheus, so as not to slay him, tell me; for in my opinion this is not
  wise, having taken our enemies, not to exact punishment of them.</p>

  <p>SERV. Having respect for you, that with your own eyes you may see
  him<a name="Heraclid_30"></a><a href="#HeraclidN_30"><sup>[30]</sup></a>
  defeated and subjected to your hand; not, indeed, of his own will, but he
  has bound him by force in constraint, for he was not willing to come
  alive into your sight and to be punished. But, O old woman, farewell, and
  remember for me what you first said when I began my tale. Make me free;
  and in such noble people as you the mouth ought to be free from
  falsehood.</p>

  <p>CHOR. To me the dance is sweet, if there be the thrilling delight of
  the pipe at the feast; and may Venus be kind. And sweet it is to see the
  good fortune of friends who did not expect it before; for the fate which
  accomplishes gifts gives birth to many things; and Time, the son of
  Saturn. You have, O city, a just path, you should never be deprived of
  it, to honor the Gods; and he who bids you not do so, is near madness,
  such proofs as these being shown. God, in truth, evidently exhorts us,
  taking away the arrogance of the unjust forever. Your son, O old woman,
  is gone to heaven; he shuns the report of having descended to the realm
  of Pluto, being consumed as to his body in the terrible flame of fire;
  and he embraces the lovely bed of Hebe in the golden hall. O Hymen, you
  have honored two children of Jupiter. Many things agree with many; for in
  truth they say that Minerva was an ally of their father, and the city and
  people of that Goddess has saved them, and has restrained the insolence
  of a man to whom passion was before justice, through violence. May my
  mind and soul, never be insatiable.</p>

  <p>MESS. O mistress, you see, but still it shall be said, we are come,
  bringing to you Eurystheus here, an unhoped-for sight, and one no less so
  for him to meet with, for he never expected to come into your hands when
  he went forth from Mycenæ with a much-toiling band of spearmen, proudly
  planning things much greater than his fortune, that he should destroy
  Athens; but the God changed his fortune, and made it contrary. Hyllus,
  therefore, and the good Iolaus, have set up a statue, in honor of their
  victory, of Jove, the putter to flight; and they send me to bring this
  man to you, wishing to delight your mind; for it is most delightful to
  see an enemy unfortunate, after having been fortunate.</p>

  <p>ALC. O hateful thing, art thou come? has justice taken you at last?
  first then indeed turn hither your head toward me, and dare to look your
  enemies in the face; for now you are ruled, and you rule no more. Art
  thou he, for I wish to know, who chose, O wretch, much to insult my son,
  though no longer existing? For in what respect didst thou not dare to
  insult him? who led him, while alive, down to hell, and sent him forth,
  bidding him destroy hydras and lions? And I am silent concerning the
  other evils you contrived, for it would be a long story; and it did not
  satisfy you that he alone should endure these things, but you drove me
  also, and my children, out of all Greece, sitting as suppliants of the
  Gods, some old, and some still infants; but you found men and a city
  free, who feared you not. Thou needs must die miserably, and you shall
  gain every thing, for you ought to die not once only, having wrought many
  evil deeds.</p>

  <p>MESS. It is not practicable for you to put him to death.<a
  name="Heraclid_31"></a><a href="#HeraclidN_31"><sup>[31]</sup></a></p>

  <p>ALC. In vain then have we taken him prisoner. But what law hinders him
  from dying?</p>

  <p>MESS. It seems not so to the chiefs of this land.</p>

  <p>ALC. What is this? not good to them to slay one's enemies?</p>

  <p>MESS. Not any one whom they have taken alive in battle.</p>

  <p>ALC. And did Hyllus endure this decision?</p>

  <p>MESS. He could, I suppose, disobey this land!<a
  name="Heraclid_32"></a><a href="#HeraclidN_32"><sup>[32]</sup></a></p>

  <p>ALC. He ought no longer to live, nor behold the light.</p>

  <p>MESS. Then first he did wrong in not dying.</p>

  <p>ALC. Then it is no longer right for him to be punished?<a
  name="Heraclid_33"></a><a href="#HeraclidN_33"><sup>[33]</sup></a></p>

  <p>MESS. There is no one who may put him to death.</p>

  <p>ALC. I will. And yet I say that I am some one.</p>

  <p>MESS. You will indeed have much blame if you do this.</p>

  <p>ALC. I love this city. It can not be denied. But as for this man,
  since he has come into my power, there is no mortal who shall take him
  from me. For this, whoever will may call me bold, and thinking things too
  much for a woman; but this deed shall be done by me.</p>

  <p>CHOR. It is a serious and excusable thing, O lady, for you to have
  hatred against this man, I well know it.</p>

  <p>EURYSTHEUS. O woman, know plainly that I will not flatter you, nor say
  any thing else for my life, whence I may incur any imputation of
  cowardice. But not of my own accord did I undertake this strife&mdash;I
  knew that I was your cousin by birth, and a relation to your son
  Hercules; but whether I wished it or not, Juno, for it was a Goddess,
  forced me to toil through this ill. But when I took up enmity against
  him, and determined to contest this contest, I became a contriver of many
  evils, and sitting continually in council with myself, I brought forth
  many plans by night, how dispersing and slaying my enemies, I might dwell
  for the future not with fear, knowing that your son was not one of the
  many, but truly a man; for though he be mine enemy, yet shall he be well
  spoken of, as he was a doughty man. And when he was released [from life],
  did it not behoove me, being hated by these children, and knowing their
  father's hatred to me, to move every stone, slaying and banishing them,
  and contriving, that, doing such things, my own affairs would have been
  safe? You, therefore, had you obtained my fortunes, would not have
  oppressed with evils the hostile offspring of a hated lion, but would
  wisely have permitted them to live in Argos; you will persuade no one of
  this. Now then, since they did not destroy me then, when I was willing,
  by the laws of the Greeks I shall, if slain, bear pollution to my slayer;
  and the city, being wise, has let me go, having greater honor for God
  than for its enmity toward me. And to what you said you have heard a
  reply: and now you may call me at once suppliant and brave.<a
  name="Heraclid_34"></a><a href="#HeraclidN_34"><sup>[34]</sup></a> Thus
  is the case with me, I do not wish to die, but I should not be grieved at
  leaving life.</p>

  <p>CHOR. I wish, O Alcmena, to advise you a little, to let go this man,
  since it seems so to the city.</p>

  <p>ALC. But how, if he both die, and still we obey the city?</p>

  <p>CHOR. That would be best; but how can that be?</p>

  <p>ALC. I will teach you, easily; for having slain him, then I will give
  his corpse to those of his friends who come after him; for I will not
  deny his body to the earth, but he dying, shall satisfy my revenge.</p>

  <p>EU. Slay me, I do not deprecate thy wrath. But this city indeed, since
  it has released me, and feared to slay me, I will present with an ancient
  oracle of Apollo, which, in time, will be of greater profit than you
  would expect; for ye will bury me when I am dead, where it is fated,
  before the temple of the divine virgin of Pallene; and being well
  disposed to you, and a protector to the city, I shall ever lie as a
  sojourner under the ground, but most hostile to their descendants when
  they come hither with much force, betraying this kindness: such strangers
  do ye now defend. How then did I, knowing this, come hither, and not
  respect the oracle of the God? Thinking Juno far more powerful than
  oracles, and that she would not betray me, [I did so.] But suffer neither
  libations nor blood to be poured on my tomb, for I will give them an evil
  return as a requital for these things; and ye shall have a double gain
  from me, I will both profit you and injure them by dying.</p>

  <p>ALC. Why then do ye delay, if you are fated to accomplish safety to
  the city and to your descendants, to slay this man, hearing these things?
  for they show us the safest path. The man is an enemy, but he will profit
  us dying. Take him away, O servants; then having slain him, ye must give
  him to the dogs; for hope not thou, that living, thou shalt again banish
  me from my native land.</p>

  <p>CHOR. These things seem good to me, proceed, O attendants, for every
  thing on our part shall be done completely for our sovereigns.</p>

  descendants of Hercules should be devoted, and that upon this Macaria,
  his daughter by Deianira, voluntarily offered herself. Her name was
  afterward given to a fountain. Enripides probably omitted this fact, in
  order to place the noble-mindedness of Macaria in a stronger light. The

<h3>THE ARGUMENT.</h3>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>When the Greeks were detained at Aulis by stress of weather, Calchas
  declared that they would never reach Troy unless the daughter of
  Agamemnon, Iphigenia, was sacrificed to Diana. Agamemnon sent for his
  daughter with this view, but repenting, he dispatched a messenger to
  prevent Clytæmnestra sending her. The messenger being intercepted by
  Menelaus, an altercation between the brother chieftains arose, during
  which Iphigenia, who had been tempted with the expectation of being
  wedded to Achilles, arrived with her mother. The latter, meeting with
  Achilles, discovered the deception, and Achilles swore to protect her.
  But Iphigenia, having determined to die nobly on behalf of the Greeks,
  was snatched away by the Goddess, and a stag substituted in her place.
  The Greeks were then enabled to set sail.</p>

<h2>IPHIGENIA IN AULIS.</h2>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>AGAMEMNON. Come before this dwelling, O aged man.</p>

  <p>OLD MAN. I come. But what new thing dost thou meditate, king
  Agamemnon?</p>

  <p>AG. You shall learn.<a name="IA_1"></a><a
  href="#IAN_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

  <p>OLD M. I hasten. My old age is very sleepless, and sits wakeful upon
  mine eyes.</p>

  <p>AG. What star can this be that traverses this way?</p>

  <p>OLD M. Sirius, flitting yet midway (between the heavens and the
  ocean,)<a name="IA_2"></a><a href="#IAN_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> close to
  the seven Pleiads.</p>

  <p>AG. No longer therefore is there the sound either of birds or of the
  sea, but silence of the winds reigns about this Euripus.</p>

  <p>OLD M. But why art thou hastening without the tent, king Agamemnon?
  But still there is silence here by Aulis, and the guards of the
  fortifications are undisturbed. Let us go within.</p>

  <p>AG. I envy thee, old man, and I envy that man who has passed through a
  life without danger, unknown, unglorious; but I less envy those in
  honor.</p>

  <p>OLD M. And yet 'tis in this that the glory of life is.</p>

  <p>AG. But this very glory is uncertain, for the love of popularity is
  pleasant indeed, but hurts when present. Sometimes the worship of the
  Gods not rightly conducted upturns one's life, and sometimes the many and
  dissatisfied opinions of men harass.</p>

  <p>OLD M. I praise not these remarks in a chieftain. O Agamemnon, Atreus
  did not beget thee upon a condition of complete good fortune.<a
  name="IA_3"></a><a href="#IAN_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> But thou needs must
  rejoice and grieve; [in turn,] for thou art a mortal born, and even
  though you wish it not, the will of the Gods will be thus. But thou,
  opening the light of a lamp, art both writing this letter, which thou
  still art carrying in thy hands, and again you blot out the same
  characters, and seal, and loose again, and cast the tablet to the ground,
  pouring abundant tears, and thou lackest naught of the unwonted things
  that tend to madness. Why art thou troubled, why art thou troubled? What
  new thing, what new thing [has happened] concerning thee, O king? Come,
  communicate discourse with me. But thou wilt speak to a good and faithful
  man, for to thy wife Tyndarus sent me once on a time, as a dower-gift,
  and disinterested companion.<a name="IA_4"></a><a
  href="#IAN_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>

  <p>AG. To Leda, daughter of Thestias, were born three virgins,
  Ph&#339;be, and Clytæmnestra my spouse, and Helen. Of this latter, the
  youths of Greece that were in the first state of prosperity came as
  suitors. But terrible threats of bloodshed<a name="IA_5"></a><a
  href="#IAN_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> arose against one another, from whoever
  should not obtain the virgin. But the matter was difficult for her father
  Tyndarus, whether to give, or not to give [her in marriage,] and how he
  might best deal with the circumstances, when this occurred to him; that
  the suitors should join oaths and plight right hands with one another,
  and over burnt-offerings should enter into treaty, and bind themselves by
  this oath, "Of whomsoever the daughter of Tyndarus shall become wife,
  that they will join to assist him, if any one should depart from his
  house taking [her] with him, and excluding the possessor from his bed,
  and that they will make an expedition in arms, and sack the city [of the
  ravisher,] Greek or barbarian alike." But after they had pledged
  themselves, the old man Tyndarus somehow cleverly overreached them by a
  cunning plan. He permits his daughter to choose one of the suitors,
  toward whom the friendly gales of Venus might impel her. But she chose
  (whom would she had never taken!) Menelaus. And he who, according to the
  story told by men, once judged the Goddesses, coming from Phrygia to
  Lacedæmon, flowered in the vesture of his garments, and glittering with
  gold, barbarian finery, loving Helen who loved him, he stole and bore her
  away to the bull-stalls of Ida, having found Menelaus abroad. But he,
  goaded hastily<a name="IA_6"></a><a href="#IAN_6"><sup>[6]</sup></a>
  through Greece, calls to witness the old oath given to Tyndarus, that it
  behooves to assist the aggrieved. Henceforth the Greeks hastening with
  the spear, having taken their arms, come to this Aulis with its narrow
  straits, with ships and shields together, and accoutred with many horses
  and chariots. And they chose me general of the host, out of regard for
  Menelaus, being his brother forsooth. And would that some other than I
  had obtained the dignity. But when the army was assembled and levied, we
  sat, having no power of sailing, at Aulis. But Calchas the seer
  proclaimed to us, being at a loss, that we should sacrifice Iphigenia,
  whom I begat, to Diana, who inhabits this place, and that if we
  sacrificed her, we should have both our voyage, and the sacking of Troy,
  but that this should not befall us if we did not sacrifice her. But I
  hearing this in rousing proclamation, bade Talthybius dismiss the whole
  army, as I should never have the heart to slay my daughter. Upon this,
  indeed, my brother, alleging every kind of reasoning, persuaded me to
  dare the dreadful deed, and having written in the folds of a letter, I
  sent word to my wife to send her daughter as if to be married to
  Achilles, both enlarging on the dignity of the man, and asserting that he
  would not sail with the Greeks, unless a wife for him from among us
  should come to Phthia. For I had this means of persuading my wife, having
  made up a pretended match for the virgin. But we alone of the Greeks know
  how these matters are, Calchas, Ulysses, and Nestor. But the things which
  I then determined not well, I am now differently writing so as to be
  well, in this letter, which by the shadow of night thou beheldest me
  opening and closing, old man. But come, go thou, taking these letters, to
  Argos. But as to what the letter conceals in its folds, I will tell thee
  in words all that is written therein; for thou art faithful to my wife
  and house.</p>

  <p>OLD M. Speak, and tell me, that with my tongue I may also say what
  agrees with your letter.</p>

  <p>AG. (reading) "I send to thee, O germ of Leda, besides<a
  name="IA_7"></a><a href="#IAN_7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> my former dispatches,
  not to send thy daughter to the bay-like wing of Eub&#339;a,<a
  name="IA_8"></a><a href="#IAN_8"><sup>[8]</sup></a> waveless Aulis. For
  we will delay the bridals of our daughter till another season."</p>

  <p>OLD M. And how will not Achilles raise up his temper against thee and
  thy wife, showing great wrath at failing of his spouse? This also is
  terrible. Show what thou meanest.</p>

  <p>AG. Achilles, furnishing the pretext, not the reality, knows not these
  nuptials, nor what we are doing; nor that I have professed to give my
  daughter into the nuptial chain of his arms by marriage.<a
  name="IA_9"></a><a href="#IAN_9"><sup>[9]</sup></a></p>

  <p>OLD M. Thou venturest terrible things, king Agamemnon, who, having
  promised thy daughter as wife to the son of the Goddess, dost lead her as
  a sacrifice on behalf of the Greeks.</p>

  <p>AG. Ah me! I was out of my senses. Alas! And I am falling into
  calamity. But go, plying thy foot, yielding naught to old age.</p>

  <p>OLD M. I hasten, O king.</p>

  <p>AG. Do not thou either sit down by the woody fountains, nor repose in
  sleep.</p>

  <p>OLD M. Speak good words.</p>

  <p>AG. But every where as you pass the double track, look about, watching
  lest there escape thee a chariot passing with swift wheels, bearing my
  daughter hither to the ships of the Greeks.</p>

  <p>OLD M. This shall be.</p>

  <p>AG. And go out of the gates<a name="IA_10"></a><a
  href="#IAN_10"><sup>[10]</sup></a> quickly,&#x2020; for if you meet with
  the procession,&#x2020; again go forth, shake the reins, going to the
  temples reared by the Cyclops.</p>

  <p>OLD M. But tell me, how, saying this, I shall obtain belief from thy
  daughter and wife.</p>

  <p>AG. Preserve the seal, this which thou bearest on this letter. Go:
  morn, already dawning forth this light, grows white, and the fire of the
  sun's four steeds. Aid me in my toils. But no one of mortals is
  prosperous or blest to the last, for none hath yet been born free from
  pain.</p>

  <p>CHORUS. I came to the sands of the shore of marine Aulis, having
  sailed through the waves of Euripus, quitting Chalcis with its narrow
  strait, my city, the nurse of the sea-neighboring waters<a
  name="IA_11"></a><a href="#IAN_11"><sup>[11]</sup></a> of renowned
  Arethusa, in order that I might behold the army of the Greeks, and the
  ship-conveying oars of the Grecian youths, whom against Troy in a
  thousand ships of fir, our husbands say that yellow-haired Menelaus and
  Agamemnon of noble birth, are leading in quest of Helen,<a
  name="IA_12"></a><a href="#IAN_12"><sup>[12]</sup></a> whom the herdsman
  Paris bore from reed-nourishing Eurotas, a gift of Venus, when at the
  fountain dews Venus held contest, contest respecting beauty with Juno and
  Pallas. But I came swiftly through the wood of Diana with its many
  sacrifices, making my cheek red with youthful modesty, wishing to behold
  the defense of the shield, and the arm-bearing tents<a
  name="IA_13"></a><a href="#IAN_13"><sup>[13]</sup></a> of the Greeks, and
  the crowd of steeds. But I saw the two Ajaces companions, the son of
  Oileus, and the son of Telamon, the glory of Salamis, and Protesilaus and
  Palamedes, whom the daughter of Neptune bore, diverting themselves<a
  name="IA_14"></a><a href="#IAN_14"><sup>[14]</sup></a> with the
  complicated figures of draughts, and Diomede rejoicing in the pleasures
  of the disk, and by them Merione, the blossom of Mars, a marvel to
  mortals, and the son of Laertes from the mountains of the isle, and with
  them Nireus, fairest of the Greeks, and Achilles, tempest-like in the
  course, fleet as the winds, whom Thetis bore, and Chiron trained up, I
  beheld him on the shore, coursing in arms along the shingles. And he
  toiled through a contest of feet, running against a chariot of four
  steeds for victory. But the charioteer cried out, Eumelus, the grandson
  of Pheres,<a name="IA_15"></a><a href="#IAN_15"><sup>[15]</sup></a> whose
  most beauteous steeds I beheld, decked out with gold-tricked bits,
  hurried on by the lash, the middle ones in yoke dappled with
  white-spotted hair, but those outside, in loose harness, running
  contrariwise in the bendings of the course, bays, with dappled skins
  under their legs with solid hoofs. Close by which Pelides was running in
  arms, by the orb and wheels of the chariot.<a name="IA_16"></a><a
  href="#IAN_16"><sup>[16]</sup></a> And I came to the multitude of ships,
  a sight not to be described, that I might satiate the sight of my woman's
  eyes, a sweet delight. And at the right horn [of the fleet] was the
  Phthiotic army of the Myrmidons, with fifty valiant ships. And in golden
  effigies the Nereid Goddesses stood on the summit of the poops, the
  standard of the host of Achilles. And next to these there stood the
  Argive ships, with equal number of oars, of which [Euryalus] the grandson
  of Mecisteus was general, whom his father Talaus trains up, and Sthenelus
  son of Capaneus. But [Acamas] son of Theseus, leading sixty ships from
  Athens, kept station, having the Goddess Pallas placed<a
  name="IA_17"></a><a href="#IAN_17"><sup>[17]</sup></a> in her equestrian
  winged chariot, a prosperous sign to sailors. But I beheld the armament
  of the B&#339;otians, fifty sea-bound ships, with signs at the
  figure-heads, and their sign was Cadmus, holding a golden dragon, at the
  beaks of the ships, and Leitus the earth-born was leader of the naval
  armament, and [I beheld] those from the Phocian land. But the son of
  Oileus, leading an equal number of Locrian ships, came, having left the
  Thronian city. But from Cyclopian Mycenæ the son of Atreus sent the
  assembled mariners of a hundred ships. And with him was Adrastus, as
  friend with friend, in order that Greece might wreak vengeance on those
  who fled their homes, for the sake of barbarian nuptials. But from Pylos
  we beheld on the poops of Gerenian Nestor, a sign bull-footed to view,
  his neighbor Alpheus. But there were twelve beaks of Ænian ships, which
  king Gyneus led, and near these again the chieftains of Elis, whom all
  the people named Epeians, and o'er these Eurytus had power. But the
  white-oared Taphian host *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* led,<a name="IA_18"></a><a
  href="#IAN_18"><sup>[18]</sup></a> which Meges ruled, the offspring of
  Phyleus, leaving the island Echinades, inaccessible to sailors. And Ajax,
  the foster-child of Salamis, joined the right horn to the left, to which
  he was stationed nearest, joining them with his furthermost ships, with
  twelve most swift vessels, as I heard, and beheld the naval people. To
  which if any one add the barbarian barks, *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* it will not obtain a
  return. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* Where I beheld the naval expedition, but hearing other
  things at home I preserve remembrance of the assembled army.</p>

  thou wast, taking hold of every right hand, and keeping open doors to any
  of the people that wished, and giving audience to all in turn even if one
  wished it not, seeking by manners to purchase popularity among the

  but then chiefly to be firm toward his friends, when he is best able to
  benefit them, being prosperous. I have first gone over these charges
  against thee, in which I first found thee base. But when thou afterward
  camest into Aulis and to the army of all the Greeks, thou wast naught,
  but wast in stupefaction at the fortune which then befell us from the
  Gods, lacking a favorable breeze for the journey. But the Greeks demanded
  that you should dismiss the ships, and not toil vainly at Aulis. But how
  cheerless and distressed a countenance you wore, because you were not
  able to land your army at Priam's land, having a thousand ships under
  command.<a name="IA_23"></a><a href="#IAN_23"><sup>[23]</sup></a> And
  thou besoughtest me, "What shall I do?" "But what resource shall I find
  from whence?" so that thou mightest not lose an ill renown, being
  deprived of the command. And then, when Calchas o'er the victims said
  that thou must sacrifice thy daughter to Diana, and that there would
  [then] be means of sailing for the Greeks, delighted in heart, you gladly
  promised to sacrifice your child, and of your own accord, not by
  compulsion&mdash;do not say so&mdash;you send to your wife to convoy your
  daughter hither, on a pretext of being wedded to Achilles. And then
  changing [your mind] you are caught altering to other writings, to the
  effect that you will not now be the slayer of your daughter. Very pretty,
  forsooth! This is the same air which heard these very protestations from
  thee. But innumerable men experience this in their affairs; they
  persevere in labor when in power,<a name="IA_24"></a><a
  href="#IAN_24"><sup>[24]</sup></a> and then make a bad result, sometimes
  through the foolish mind of the citizens, but sometimes with reason,
  themselves becoming incapable of preserving the state, I indeed chiefly
  groan for hapless Greece, who, wishing to work some doughty deed against
  these good-for-nothing barbarians, will let them, laughing at us, slip
  through her hands, on account of thee and thy daughter. I would not make
  any one ruler of the land for the sake of necessity,<a
  name="IA_25"></a><a href="#IAN_25"><sup>[25]</sup></a> nor chieftain of
  armed men. It behooves the general of the state to possess sense, for
  every man is a ruler who possesses sense.</p>

  <p>AG. I wish to address thee in evil terms, but mildly,<a
  name="IA_26"></a><a href="#IAN_26"><sup>[26]</sup></a> in brief, not
  uplifting mine eyelids too much aloft through insolence, but moderately,
  as being my brother. For a good man is wont to show respect [to others.]
  Tell me, why dost thou burst forth thus violently, having thy face
  suffused with rage? Who wrongs thee? What lackest thou? Wouldst fain gain
  a good wife! I can not supply thee, for thou didst ill rule over the one
  you possessed. Must I therefore pay the penalty of your mismanagement,
  who have made no mistake? Or does my ambition annoy thee? But wouldst
  thou fain hold in thine arms a fair woman, forgetting discretion and
  honor? Evil pleasures belong to an evil man. But if I, having before
  resolved ill, have changed to good counsel, am I mad? Rather art thou
  [mad,] who, having lost a bad wife, desirest to recover her, when God has
  well prospered thy fortune. The nuptial-craving suitors in their folly
  swore the oath to Tyndarus, but hope, I ween, was their God, and wrought
  this more than thyself and thy strength. Whom taking<a
  name="IA_27"></a><a href="#IAN_27"><sup>[27]</sup></a> make thou the
  expedition, but I think thou wilt know [that it is] through the folly of
  their hearts, for the divinity is not ignorant, but is capable of
  discerning oaths ill plighted and perforce. But I will not slay my
  children, so that thy state will in justice be well, revenge upon the
  worst of wives, but nights and days will waste me away in tears, having
  wrought lawless, unjust deeds against the children whom I begat. These
  words are briefly spoken to thee, both plain and easy, but if thou art
  unwilling to be wise, I will arrange my own affairs well.</p>

  <p>CHOR. These words are different from those before spoken, but they are
  to a good effect, that the children be spared.</p>

  <p>MEN. Alas! alas! have I then wretched no friends?</p>

  <p>AG. [Yes, you have,] at least, if you do not wish to ruin your
  friends.</p>

  <p>MEN. But how will you show that you are born of the same sire with
  me?</p>

  <p>AG. I am born to be wise with you, not foolish.<a name="IA_28"></a><a

  Greece?</p>

  <p>AG. But Greece, with thee, is sickening through some deity.</p>

<p class="center">[<i>Enter a Messenger</i>.<a name="IA_29"></a><a href="#IAN_29"><sup>[29]</sup></a>]</p>

  <p>MESSENGER. O Agamemnon, king of all the Greeks, I am come, bringing
  thy daughter to thee, whom thou didst name Iphigenia in thy palace. But
  her mother follows, the person of thy [wife] Clytæmnestra, and the boy
  Orestes, that thou mayest be pleased at the sight, being away from thine
  home a long season. But as they have come a long way, they and their
  mares are refreshing their female feet by the fair-flowing fountain, and
  we let loose the mares in a grassy meadow, that they might taste fodder.
  But I am come before them to prepare you [for their reception,] for a
  swift report passed through the army, that thy daughter had arrived. And
  all the multitude comes out hastily to the spectacle, that they may
  behold thy child. For prosperous men are renowned and conspicuous among
  all mortals. And they say, "Is there a marriage on foot? or what is going
  on?" Or, "Has king Agamemnon, having a yearning after his daughter,
  brought his child hither?" But from some you would have heard this: "They
  are initiating<a name="IA_30"></a><a href="#IAN_30"><sup>[30]</sup></a>
  the damsel in honor of Artemis, queen of Aulis, who will marry her." But
  come, get ready the baskets,<a name="IA_31"></a><a
  href="#IAN_31"><sup>[31]</sup></a> which come next, crown thine head. And
  do thou, king Menelaus, prepare a nuptial lay, and through the house let
  the pipe sound and let there be noise of feet, for this day comes blessed
  upon the virgin.</p>

  <p>AG. I commend [your words,] but go thou within the house, and it shall
  be well, as fortune takes its course. Alas! what shall I wretched say?
  Whence shall I begin? Into what fetters of necessity have I fallen!
  Fortune has upturned me, so as to become far too clever for my
  cleverness. But lowness of birth has some advantage thus. For such
  persons are at liberty to weep, and speak unhappy words, but to him that
  is of noble birth, all these things belong. We have our dignity as ruler
  of our life, and are slaves to the multitude. For I am ashamed indeed to
  let fall the tear, yet again wretched am I ashamed not to weep, having
  come into the greatest calamities. Well! what shall I say to my wife? How
  shall I receive her? What manner of countenance shall I present? And
  truly she hath undone me, coming uncalled amidst the ills which before
  possessed me. And with reason did she follow her daughter, being about to
  deck her as a bride,<a name="IA_32"></a><a
  href="#IAN_32"><sup>[32]</sup></a> and to perform the dearest offices,
  where she will find us base. But for this hapless virgin&mdash;why [call
  her] virgin? Hades, as it seems, will speedily attend on her
  nuptials,&mdash;how do I pity her! For I think that she will beseech me
  thus: O father, wilt thou slay me? Such a wedding mayest thou thyself
  wed, and whosoever is a friend to thee. But Orestes being present will
  cry out knowingly words not knowing, for he is yet an infant. Alas! how
  has Priam's son, Paris, undone me by wedding the nuptials of Paris, who
  has wrought this!</p>

  <p>CHOR. And I also pity her, as it becomes a stranger woman to moan for
  the misfortune of her lords.</p>

  <p>MEN. Brother, give me thy right hand to touch.</p>

  <p>AG. I give it, for thine is the power, but I am wretched.</p>

  <p>MEN. I swear by Pelops, who was called the sire of my father and
  thine, and my father Atreus, that I indeed will tell thee plainly from my
  heart, and not any thing out of contrivance, but only what I think. I,
  beholding thee letting fall the tear from thine eyes, pitied thee, and
  myself let fall [a tear] for thee in return. And I have changed<a
  name="IA_33"></a><a href="#IAN_33"><sup>[33]</sup></a> my old
  determinations, not being wrath against you, but I will place myself in
  your present situation, and I recommend you neither to slay your child,
  nor to take my part; for it is not just that thou shouldst groan, but my
  affairs be in a pleasant state, and that thine should die, but mine
  behold the light. For what do I wish? Might I not obtain another choice
  alliance, if I crave nuptials? But, having undone my brother, whom it
  least behooved me, shall I receive Helen, an evil in place of a good? I
  was foolish and young, before that, viewing the matter closely, I saw
  what it is to beget children. Besides, pity came over me, considering our
  connection, for the hapless girl, who is about to be sacrificed because
  of my marriage. But what has thy virgin [daughter] to do with Helen? Let
  the army go, being disbanded from Aulis. But cease thou bedewing thine
  eyes with tears, my brother, and exciting me to tears. But if I have any
  concern in the oracle respecting thy daughter, let me have none: to thee
  I yield my part. But I have come to a change<a name="IA_34"></a><a
  href="#IAN_34"><sup>[34]</sup></a> from terrible resolutions. I
  have experienced<a name="IA_35"></a><a href="#IAN_35"><sup>[35]</sup></a>
  what was meet. I have changed to regard him who is sprung from a common
  source. Such changes belong not to a bad man, [viz.] to follow the best
  always.</p>

  <p>CHOR. Thou hast spoken generous words, and becoming Tantalus the son
  of Jove. Thou disgracest not thine ancestors.</p>

  <p>AG. I commend thee, Menelaus, in that, contrary to my expectation, you
  have subjoined these words, rightly, and worthily of thee.</p>

  <p>MEN. A certain disturbance<a name="IA_36"></a><a
  href="#IAN_36"><sup>[36]</sup></a> between brothers arises on account of
  love, and avarice in their houses. I abhor such a relationship, mutually
  sore.</p>

  <p>AG. But [consider,] for we are come into circumstances that render it
  necessary to accomplish the bloody slaughter of my daughter.</p>

  <p>MEN. How? Who will compel thee to slay thy child?</p>

  <p>AG. The whole assembly of the armament of the Greeks.</p>

  <p>MEN. Not so, if at least thou dismiss it back to Argos.</p>

  <p>AG. In this matter I might escape discovery, but in that I can not.<a
  name="IA_37"></a><a href="#IAN_37"><sup>[37]</sup></a></p>

  <p>MEN. What? One should not too much fear the multitude.</p>

  <p>AG. Calchas will proclaim his prophecy to the army of the Greeks.</p>

  <p>MEN. Not if he die first&mdash;and this is easy.</p>

  <p>AG. The whole race of seers is an ambitious ill.</p>

  <p>MEN. And in naught good or profitable, when at hand.<a
  name="IA_38"></a><a href="#IAN_38"><sup>[38]</sup></a></p>

  <p>AG. But dost thou not fear that which occurs to me?</p>

  <p>MEN. How can I understand the word you say not?</p>

  <p>AG. The son of Sisyphus knows all these matters.</p>

  <p>MEN. It can not be that Orestes can pain thee and me.</p>

  <p>AG. He is ever changeable, and with the multitude.</p>

  <p>MEN. He is indeed possessed with the passion for popularity, a
  dreadful evil.</p>

  <p>AG. Do you not then think that he, standing in the midst of the
  Greeks, will tell the oracles which Calchas pronounced, and of me, that I
  promised to offer a sacrifice to Diana, and then break my word. With
  which [words] having carried away the army, he will bid the Greeks slay
  thee and me, and sacrifice the damsel. And if I flee to Argos, they will
  come and ravage and raze the land, Cyclopean walls and all. Such are my
  troubles. O unhappy me! How, by the Gods, am I at a loss in these present
  matters! Take care of one thing for me, Menelaus, going through the army,
  that Clytæmnestra may not learn these matters, before I take and offer my
  daughter to Hades, that I may fare ill with as few tears as possible. But
  do ye, O stranger women, preserve silence.</p>

  Aphrodite,<a name="IA_39"></a><a href="#IAN_39"><sup>[39]</sup></a> when

  stings, when Love with his golden locks stretches his twin bow of graces,
  the one for a prosperous fate, the other for the upturning of life. I
  deprecate this [bow,] O fairest Venus, from our beds, but may mine be a
  moderate grace, and holy endearments, and may I share Aphrodite, but
  reject her when excessive. But the natures of mortals are different, and
  their manners are different,<a name="IA_40"></a><a

  drove thee mad, which sends thee into Greece,&#x2020; before the
  ivory-decked palaces, thou who didst strike love into the eyes of Helen

  mortals who are unblest. [Let us stand still, ye children of Chalcis, let
  us receive the queen from her chariot to the earth, not unsteadily, but

  <p>CLY. I regard both your kindness and your favorable words as a good
  omen, and I have some hope that I am here as escort [of my daughter] to
  honorable nuptials. But take out of my chariot the dower-gifts which I
  bear for my girl, and send them carefully into the house. And do thou, my
  child, quit the horse-chariot, setting [carefully] thy foot delicate and
  at the same time tender. But you,<a name="IA_48"></a><a

  lift her from the chariot. And let some one give me the firm support of
  his hand, that I may beseemingly leave the chariot-seat. But do some<a
  name="IA_49"></a><a href="#IAN_49"><sup>[49]</sup></a> of you stand in
  front of the horses' yoke, for the uncontrolled eye of horses is
  timorous, and take this boy, the son of Agamemnon, Orestes, for he is
  still an infant. Child! dost sleep, overcome by the ride? Wake up happily
  for thy sisters' nuptials. For thou thyself being noble shalt obtain
  relationship with a good man, the God-like son of the daughter of Nereus.

  inhabit?</p>

  <p>AG. Near the river Apidanus in the confines of Phthia.</p>

  <p>AG. I will furnish the light that becomes the nuptials.</p>

  <p>CHORUS. The assembly of the Grecian army will come to Simois, and to
  the silver eddies, both with ships and with arms, to Ilium, and to the
  Ph&#339;beian plain of Troy, where I hear that Cassandra, adorned with a
  green-blossoming crown of laurel, lets loose her yellow locks, when the
  prophetic influence of the Gods breathes upon her. And the Trojans will
  stand upon the towers of Troy and around its walls, when brazen-shielded
  Mars, borne over the sea in fair-prowed ships, approaches the beds of
  Simois by rowing, seeking to bear away Helen, [the sister] of the twain
  sons of Jove in heaven, into the land of Greece, by the war-toiling
  shields and spears of the Greeks. But having surrounded Pergamus,<a
  name="IA_63"></a><a href="#IAN_63"><sup>[63]</sup></a> the city of the
  Phrygians, around its towers of stone, with bloody Mars, having torn off
  the heads [of the citizens] cut from their necks, having completely
  ravaged the city of Troy, he will make the daughters and wife of Priam
  shed many tears. But Helen, the daughter of Jove, will sit&#x2020; in sad
  lamentation, having left her husband. Never upon me or upon my children's
  children may this expectation come, such as the wealthy Lydian and
  Phrygian wives possess while at their spinning, conversing thus with each
  other. Who,<a name="IA_64"></a><a href="#IAN_64"><sup>[64]</sup></a>
  dragging out my fair-haired tresses, will choose me as his spoil despite
  my tears, while my country is perishing? Through thee [forsooth,] the
  offspring of the long-necked swan, if indeed the report is true, that
  Leda &#x2020; met with<a name="IA_65"></a><a
  href="#IAN_65"><sup>[65]</sup></a> a winged bird, when the body of Jove
  was transformed, and then in the tablets of the muses fables spread these
  reports among men, inopportunely, and in vain.</p>

<p class="center">[<i>Enter</i> ACHILLES.]</p>

  <p>ACHILLES. Where about here is the general of the Greeks? Who of the
  servants will tell him that Achilles, the son of Peleus, is seeking him
  at the gates? For we do not remain by the Euripus in equal condition; for
  some of us being unyoked in nuptials, having left our solitary homes, sit
  here upon the shore, but others, having wives and children:<a
  name="IA_66"></a><a href="#IAN_66"><sup>[66]</sup></a> so violent a
  passion for this expedition has fallen upon Greece, not without the will
  of the Gods. It is therefore right that I should speak of what concerns
  me, and whoever else wishes will himself speak for himself. For leaving
  the Pharsalian land, and Peleus, I am waiting for these light gales of
  Euripus,<a name="IA_67"></a><a href="#IAN_67"><sup>[67]</sup></a>
  restraining the Myrmidons, who are continually pressing me, and saying,
  "Achilles, why tarry we? what manner of time must the armament against
  Troy yet measure out? At any rate act, if you are going to do any thing,
  or lead the army home, not abiding the delays of the Atrides."</p>

  <p>CLY. O son of the Goddess, daughter of Nereus, hearing from within thy
  words, I have come out before the house.</p>

  <p>ACH. O hallowed modesty, who can this woman be whom I behold here,
  possessing a fair-seeming form?</p>

  <p>CLY. It is no wonder that you know me not, whom you have never seen
  before, but I commend you because you respect modesty.</p>

  <p>ACH. But who art thou? And wherefore hast thou come to the assembly of
  the Greeks, a woman to men guarded with shields?</p>

  <p>CLY. I am the daughter of Leda, and Clytæmnestra is my name, and my
  husband is king Agamemnon.</p>

  <p>ACH. Well hast thou in few words spoken what is seasonable. But it is
  unbecoming for me to converse with women. (<i>Is going</i>.)</p>

  <p>CLY. Remain, (why dost thou fly?) at least join thy right hand with
  mine, as a happy commencement of betrothal.</p>

  <p>ACH. What sayest thou? I [give] thee my right hand? I should be
  ashamed of Agamemnon, if I touched what is not lawful for me.</p>

  <p>CLY. It is particularly lawful, since you are going to wed my
  daughter, O son of the sea Goddess, daughter of Nereus.</p>

  <p>ACH. What marriage dost thou say? Surprise possesses me, lady, unless,
  being beside yourself, you speak this new thing.</p>

  <p>CLY. This is the nature of all people, to be ashamed when they behold
  new friends, and are put in mind of nuptials.</p>

  <p>ACH. I never wooed thy daughter, lady, nor has any thing been said to
  me on the subject of marriage by the Atrides.</p>

  <p>CLY. What can it be? Do you in turn marvel at my words, for thine are
  a marvel to me.</p>

  <p>ACH. Conjecture; these matters are a common subject for conjecture,
  for both of us perhaps are deceived in our words.<a name="IA_68"></a><a
  href="#IAN_68"><sup>[68]</sup></a></p>

  <p>CLY. But surely I have suffered terrible things! I am acting as
  match-maker in regard to a marriage that has no existence. I am ashamed
  of this.</p>

  <p>ACH. Perhaps some one has trifled with both me and thee. But pay no
  attention to it, and bear it with indifference.</p>

  <p>CLY. Farewell, for I can no longer behold thee with uplifted eyes,
  having appeared as a liar, and suffered unworthy things.</p>

  <p>ACH. And this same [farewell] is thine from me. But I will go seek thy
  husband within this house.</p>

<p class="center">[<i>The</i> OLD MAN <i>appears at the door of the house</i>.]</p>

  <p>OLD M. O stranger, grandson of Æacus, remain. Ho! thee, I say, the son
  of the Goddess, and thee, the daughter of Leda.</p>

  <p>ACM. Who is it that calls, partially opening the doors? With what
  terror he calls!</p>

  <p>OLD M. A slave. I will not be nice about the title, for fortune allows
  it not.</p>

  <p>ACH. Of whom? for thou art not mine. My property and Agamemnon's are
  different.</p>

  <p>OLD M. Of this lady who is before the house, the gift of her father
  Tyndarus.</p>

  <p>ACH. We are still. Say if thou wantest any thing, for which thou hast
  stopped me.</p>

  <p>OLD M. Are ye sure that ye alone stand before these gates?</p>

  <p>CLY. Ay, so that you may speak to us only. But come out from the royal
  dwelling.</p>

  <p>OLD M. (Coming forward) O fortune, and foresight mine, preserve whom I
  wish.</p>

  <p>ACH. These words will do for<a name="IA_69"></a><a
  href="#IAN_69"><sup>[69]</sup></a> a future occasion, for they have some
  weight.</p>

  <p>CLY. By thy right hand [I beseech thee,] delay not, if thou hast aught
  to say to me.</p>

  <p>OLD M. Thou knowest then, being what manner of man, I have been by
  nature well disposed to thee and thy children.</p>

  <p>CLY. I know thee as being a faithful servant to my house.</p>

  <p>OLD M. And that king Agamemnon received me among thy dowry.</p>

  <p>CLY. Thou camest into Argos with us, and thou wast always mine.</p>

  <p>OLD M. So it is, and I am well disposed to thee, but less so to thy
  husband.</p>

  <p>CLY. Unfold now at least to me what words you are saying.</p>

  <p>OLD M. The father who begat her is about to slay thy daughter with his
  own hand.</p>

  <p>CLY. How? I deprecate thy words, old man, for thou thinkest not
  well.</p>

  <p>OLD M. Cutting the fair neck of the hapless girl with the sword.</p>

  <p>CLY. O wretched me! Is my husband mad?</p>

  <p>OLD M. He is in his right mind, save with respect to thee and thy
  daughter, but in this he is not wise.</p>

  <p>CLY. Upon what grounds? What maddening fiend impels him?</p>

  <p>OLD M. The oracles, as at least Calchas says, in order that the army
  may be able to proceed.</p>

  <p>CLY. Whither? Wretched me, and wretched she whom her father is about
  to slay?</p>

  <p>OLD M. To the house of Dardanus, that Menelaus may recover Helen.</p>

  <p>CLY. To the destruction, then, of Iphigenia, was the return of Helen
  foredoomed?</p>

  <p>OLD M. Thou hast the whole story. Her father is going to offer thy
  daughter to Diana.</p>

  <p>CLY. What! what pretext had the marriage, that brought me from
  home?</p>

  <p>OLD M. That thou rejoicing mightest bring thy child, as if about to
  wed her to Achilles.</p>

  <p>CLY. O daughter, both thou and thy mother are come to meet with
  destruction.</p>

  <p>OLD M. Ye twain are suffering sad things, and dreadful things hath
  Agamemnon dared.</p>

  <p>CLY. I wretched am undone, and my eyes no longer restrain the
  tear.</p>

  <p>OLD M. For bitter 'tis to mourn, deprived of one's children.</p>

  <p>CLY. But whence, old man, sayest thou that thou hast learned and
  knowest these things?</p>

  <p>OLD M. I went to bear a letter to thee, in reference to what was
  before written.</p>

  <p>CLY. Not allowing, or bidding me to bring my child, that she might
  die?</p>

  <p>OLD M. [It was] that you should not bring her, for your husband then
  thought well.</p>

  <p>CLY. And how was it then, that, bearing the letter, thou gavest it not
  to me?</p>

  <p>OLD M. Menelaus, who is the cause of these evils, took it from me.</p>

  <p>CLY. O child of Nereus' daughter, O son of Peleus, dost hear these
  things?</p>

  <p>ACH. I hear that thou art wretched, and I do not bear my part
  indifferently.</p>

  <p>CLY. They will slay my child, having deceived her with thy
  nuptials.</p>

  <p>ACH. I also blame thy husband, nor do I bear it lightly.</p>

  <p>CLY. I will not be ashamed to fall down at thy knee, mortal, to one
  born of a Goddess. For wherefore should I make a show of pride? Or what
  should I study more than my children? But, O son of the Goddess, aid me
  in my unhappiness, and her who is called thy wife, vainly indeed, but
  nevertheless, having decked her out, I led her as if to be married, but
  now I lead her to sacrifice, and reproach will come upon thee, who gavest
  no aid. For though thou wast not yoked in nuptials, at least thou wast
  called the beloved husband of the hapless virgin. By thy beard, by thy
  right hand, by thy mother [I beseech] thee, for thy name hath undone me,
  to whom thou shouldst needs give assistance. I have no other altar to fly
  to, but thy knee, nor is any friend near me,<a name="IA_70"></a><a
  href="#IAN_70"><sup>[70]</sup></a> but thou hearest the cruel and
  all-daring conduct of Agamemnon. But I a woman, as thou seest, have come
  to a naval host, uncontrolled, and bold for mischief, but useful, when
  they are willing. But if thou wilt venture to stretch thine hand in my
  behalf, we are saved, but if not, we are not saved.</p>

  <p>CHOR. A terrible thing it is to be a mother, and it bears a great
  endearment, and one common to all, so as to toil on behalf of their
  children.</p>

  <p>ACH. My mind is high-lifted in its thoughts,<a name="IA_71"></a><a
  href="#IAN_71"><sup>[71]</sup></a> and knows both how to grieve
  [moderately] in troubles, and to rejoice moderately in high prosperity.
  For the discreet among mortals are such as pass through life correctly
  with wisdom. Now there are certain cases where it is pleasant not to be
  too wise, and also where it is useful to possess wisdom. But I, being
  nurtured [in the dwelling] of a most pious man, Chiron, have learned to
  possess a candid disposition. And I will obey the Atrides, if indeed they
  order well, but when not well, I obey not. But here in Troy showing a
  free nature I will glorify Mars with the spear, as far as I can. But, O
  thou who hast suffered wretchedly at the hands of those dearest, in
  whatever can be done by a youth, I, showing so much pity, will set thee
  right, and thy daughter, having been called my bride, shall never be
  sacrificed by her father, for I will not furnish thy husband with my
  person to weave stratagems upon. For my name, even if he lift not up the
  sword, will slay thy daughter, but thy husband is the cause. But my body
  is no longer pure, if on my account, and because of my marriage, there
  perish a virgin who has gone through sad and unbearable troubles, and has
  been marvelously and undeservedly ill treated. I were the worst man among
  the Greeks, I were of naught (but Menelaus would be among men), not as
  born from Peleus, but from some fiend, if my name acts the murderer for
  thy husband.<a name="IA_72"></a><a href="#IAN_72"><sup>[72]</sup></a> By
  Nereus, nurtured in the damp waves, the father of Thetis, who begat me,
  king Agamemnon shall not lay hands on thy daughter, not so much as with a
  little finger, so as to touch her garments. I' faith, Sipylus, a fortress
  of barbarians, whence the [royal] generals trace their descent, shall be
  deemed a city, but the name of Phthia shall nowhere be named. And the
  seer Calchas will to his cost consecrate the sacrificial cakes and
  lustral waters. (But what man is a prophet?) who tells<a
  name="IA_73"></a><a href="#IAN_73"><sup>[73]</sup></a> a few things true,
  (but many falsely,) when he has made a hit, but when he fails, is undone.
  These words are not spoken for the sake of my wedding, (ten thousand
  girls are hunting after alliance with me,) but [because] king Agamemnon
  has been guilty of insult toward me. But it behooved him to ask [the use
  of] my name from me, as an enticement for his daughter, and Clytæmnestra
  would have been most readily persuaded to give her daughter to me as a
  husband. And I would have given her up to the Greeks, if on this account
  their passage to Troy had been impeded: I would not have refused to
  augment the common interest of those with whom I set out on the
  expedition. But now I am held as of no account by the generals, and it is
  a matter of indifference whether I benefit them or not. Soon shall my
  sword witness, which, before death came against the Phrygians,<a
  name="IA_74"></a><a href="#IAN_74"><sup>[74]</sup></a> I stained with
  spots of blood, whether any one shall take thy daughter from me. But keep
  quiet, I have appeared to thee as a most mighty God, though not [a God,]
  but nevertheless I will be such.</p>

  <p>CHOR. O son of Peleus, thou hast spoken both worthily of thyself, and
  of the marine deity, hallowed Goddess.</p>

  <p>CLY. Alas! how can I praise thee neither too much in words, nor, being
  deficient in this respect, [not] lose thy favor? For in a certain wise
  the praised dislike their praisers, if they praise too much. But I am
  ashamed at alleging pitiable words, being troubled in myself, while thou
  art not diseased with my ills. But in fact the good man has some reason,
  even though he be unconnected with them, for assisting the unfortunate.
  But pity us, for we have suffered pitiably; I, who, in the first place,
  thinking to have thee for a kinsman, cherished a vain
  hope.&mdash;Moreover, my child, by dying, might perchance become an omen
  to thy future bridals,<a name="IA_75"></a><a
  href="#IAN_75"><sup>[75]</sup></a> which thou must needs avoid. But well
  didst thou speak both first and last, for, if thou art willing, my child
  will be saved. Dost wish that she embrace thy knee as a suppliant? Such
  conduct is not virgin-like, but if thou wilt, she shall come, with her
  noble face suffused with modesty. Or shall I obtain these things from
  thee, without her presence?</p>

  <p>ACH. Let her remain within doors, for with dignity she preserves her
  dignity.</p>

  <p>CLY. Yet one must needs have modesty [only] as far as circumstances
  allow.</p>

  <p>ACH. Do thou neither bring forth thy daughter into my sight, lady, not
  let us fall into reproach for inconsiderate conduct, for our assembled
  army, being idle from home occupations, loves evil and slanderous talk.
  But at all events you will accomplish the same, whether you come to me as
  a suppliant, or do not supplicate, for a mighty contest awaits me, to
  release you from these evils. Wherefore, having heard one thing, be
  persuaded that I will not speak falsely. But if I speak falsely, and
  vainly amuse you, may I perish; but may I not perish, if I preserve the
  virgin.</p>

  <p>CLY. Mayest thou be blest, ever assisting the unhappy.</p>

  <p>ACH. Hear me then, that the matter may be well.</p>

  <p>CLY. What is this thou sayest? for one must listen to thee.</p>

  <p>ACH. Let us again persuade her father to be wiser.</p>

  <p>CLY. He is a coward, and fears the army too much.</p>

  <p>ACH. But words can conquer words.</p>

  <p>CLY. Chilly is the hope, but tell me what I must do.</p>

  <p>ACH. Beseech him first not to slay his child, but if he oppose this,
  you must come to me. For if he will be persuaded what you wish, there is
  no occasion for my efforts, for this very [consent] contains her safety.
  And I also shall appear in a better light with my friend, and the army
  will not blame me, if I transact matters by discretion rather than force.
  And if this turn out well, these things, even without my help, may turn
  out satisfactorily to thy friends and thyself.<a name="IA_76"></a><a
  href="#IAN_76"><sup>[76]</sup></a></p>

  <p>CLY. How wisely hast thou spoken! But what thou sayest must be done.
  But if I do not obtain what I seek, where shall I again see thee? Where
  must I wretched woman, coming, find thee an assistant in my troubles?</p>

  <p>ACH. We guards will watch thee when there is occasion, lest any one
  behold thee going in agitation through the host of the Greeks. But do not
  shame thy ancestral home, for Tyndarus is not worthy of an evil
  reputation, seeing he is great among the Greeks.</p>

  <p>CLY. These things shall be. Command; it is meet that I obey thee. But
  if there are Gods, you, being a just man, will receive a good reward; but
  if not, why should one toil?</p>

  <p>CHOR. What was that nuptial song that raised<a name="IA_77"></a><a
  href="#IAN_77"><sup>[77]</sup></a> its strains on the Libyan reed, and
  with the dance-loving lyre, and the reedy syrinx, when o'er Pelion at the
  feast of the Gods the fair-haired muses, striking their feet with golden
  sandals against the ground, came to the wedding of Peleus, celebrating
  with melodious sounds Thetis, and the son of Æacus, on the mountains of
  the Centaurs, through the Palian wood.</p>

  <p>But the Dardan,<a name="IA_78"></a><a
  href="#IAN_78"><sup>[78]</sup></a> [Phrygian Ganymede,] dear delight of
  Jove's bed, poured out the nectar in the golden depths of the goblets,
  and along the white sands the fifty daughters of Nereus, entwining in
  circles, adorned the nuptials of Nereus with the dance. But with darts of
  fir, and crowns of grass, the horse-mounted troop of the Centaurs came to
  the banquet of the Gods and the cup of Bacchus. And the Thessalian girls
  shouted loud,<a name="IA_79"></a><a href="#IAN_79"><sup>[79]</sup></a> "O
  daughter of Nereus," and the prophet Ph&#339;bus, and Chiron, skilled in
  letters, declared, "Thou shalt bring forth a mighty light, who shall come
  to the [Trojan] land with Myrmidons armed with spear and shield, to burn
  the renowned city of Priam, around his body armed with a covering of
  golden arms wrought by Vulcan, having them as a gift from his Goddess
  Thetis, who begat him blessed." Then the deities celebrated the nuptials
  of the noble daughter of Nereus first,<a name="IA_80"></a><a
  href="#IAN_80"><sup>[80]</sup></a> and of Peleus. But thee, [O
  Iphigenia,] they will crown on the head with flowery garlands, like as a
  pure spotted heifer from a rocky cave, making bloody the mortal throat
  [of one] not trained up with the pipe, nor amidst the songs of herdsmen,
  but as a bride<a name="IA_81"></a><a href="#IAN_81"><sup>[81]</sup></a>
  prepared by thy mother for some one of the Argives. Where has the face of
  shame, or virtue any power to prevail? Since impiety indeed has
  influence, but virtue is left behind and disregarded by mortals, and
  lawlessness governs law, and it is a common struggle for mortals, lest
  any envy of the Gods befall.</p>

  <p>CLY. I have come out of the house to seek for my husband, who has been
  absent, and has quitted the house a long time. But my hapless daughter is
  in tears, casting forth many a change of complaint, having heard the
  death her father devises for her. But I was mindful of Agamemnon who is
  now coming hither,<a name="IA_82"></a><a
  href="#IAN_82"><sup>[82]</sup></a> who will quickly be detected doing
  evil deeds against his own children.</p>

  <p>AG. Daughter of Leda, opportunely have I found you without the house,
  that I may tell thee, apart from the virgin, words which it is not meet
  for those to hear who are about to marry.</p>

  <p>CLY. And what is it, on which your convenience lays hold?</p>

  <p>AG. Send forth thy daughter from the house with her father, since the
  lustral waters are ready prepared, and the salt-cakes to scatter with the
  hands upon the purifying flame, and heifers, which needs must be slain in
  honor of the Goddess Diana before the marriage solemnities, a shedding of
  black gore.</p>

  <p>CLY. In words, indeed, thou speakest well, but for thy deeds, I know
  not how I may say thou speakest well. But come without, O daughter, for
  thou knowest all that thy father meditates, and beneath thy robes bring
  the child Orestes, thy brother. See, she is here present to obey thee.
  But the rest I will speak on her behalf and mine.</p>

  <p>AG. Child, why weepest thou, and no longer beholdest me cheerfully,
  but fixing thy face upon the ground, keepest thy vest before it?</p>

  <p>CLY. Alas! What commencement of my sorrows shall I take? For I may use
  them all as first, [both last, and middle throughout.<a

  bearing disturbed and alarmed countenances.</p>

  <p>CLY. Wilt thou answer candidly, husband, if I ask thee?</p>

  <p>AG. There needs no admonition: I would fain be questioned.</p>

  <p>CLY. Art thou going to slay thy child and mine?</p>

  <p>AG. Ah! wretched things dost thou say, and thinkest what thou shouldst
  not.</p>

  <p>CLY. Keep quiet, and first in turn answer me that.</p>

  <p>AG. But if thou askest likely things, thou wilt hear likely.</p>

  <p>CLY. I ask no other things, nor do thou answer me others.</p>

  <p>CLY. Ay, and mine too, and this child's, one of three
  unfortunates!</p>

  <p>CLY. Dost thou ask me this? This thy wit hath no wit.<a

  <p>AG. I am undone. My secret plans are betrayed.</p>

  <p>CLY. I know and have learned all that you are about to do to me, and
  the very fact of thy silence, and of thy groaning much, is a proof that
  you confess it. Do not take the trouble to say any thing.</p>

  <p>AG. Behold, I am silent: for what need is there that, falsely
  speaking, I add shamelessness to misfortune?</p>

  <p>CLY. Listen, then, for I will unfold my story, and will no longer make
  use of riddles away from the purpose. In the first place, that I may
  first reproach thee with this&mdash;thou didst wed me unwilling, and
  obtain me by force, having slain Tantalus, my former husband, and having
  dashed<a name="IA_85"></a><a href="#IAN_85"><sup>[85]</sup></a> my infant
  living to the ground, having torn him by force from my breast. And the
  twin sons of Jove, my brothers, glorying in their steeds, made war
  [against thee] but my old father Tyndarus saved you, when you had become
  a suppliant, and thou again didst possess me as a wife. When I, being
  reconciled to thee in respect to thy person and home, thou wilt bear
  witness how blameless a wife I was, both modest in respect to affection,
  and enriching thy house, so that thou both going within and without thy
  doors wast blessed. And 'tis a rare prize for a man to obtain such a
  wife, but there is no lack of getting a bad spouse. And I bear thee this
  son, besides three virgins, of one of whom thou art cruelly going to
  deprive me. And if any one ask thee on what account thou wilt slay her,
  say, what will you answer? or must I needs make your plea, "that Menelaus
  may obtain Helen?" A pretty custom, forsooth, that children must pay the
  price of a bad woman. We gain the most hateful things at the hand of
  those dearest. Come, if thou wilt set out, leaving me at home, and then
  wilt be a long time absent, what sort of feelings dost think I shall
  experience, when I behold every seat empty of this child's presence, and
  every virgin chamber empty, but myself sit in tears alone, ever mourning
  her [in such strains as these:] "My child, thy father, who begat thee,
  hath destroyed thee, himself, no other, the slayer, by no other hand,
  leaving such a reward for [my care of] the house."<a name="IA_86"></a><a
  href="#IAN_86"><sup>[86]</sup></a> Since there wants but a little reason
  for me and my remaining daughters to give thee such a reception as you
  deserve to receive. Do not, by the Gods, either compel me to act evilly
  toward thee, nor do thou thyself be so. Ah well! thou wilt sacrifice thy
  daughter&mdash;what prayers wilt thou then utter? What good thing wilt
  thou crave for thyself, slaying thy child? An evil return, seeing,
  forsooth, thou hast disgracefully set out from home. But is it right that
  I should pray for thee any good thing? Verily we must believe the Gods
  are senseless, if we feel well disposed to murderers. But wilt thou,
  returning to Argos, embrace thy children? But 'tis not lawful for thee.
  Will any of your children look upon you, if thou offerest one of them for
  slaughter? Thus far have I proceeded in my argument. What! does it only
  behoove thee to carry about thy sceptre and marshal the army?&mdash;whose
  duty it were to speak a just speech among the Greeks: "Do ye desire, O
  Greeks, to sail against the land of the Phrygians? Cast lots, whose
  daughter needs must die"&mdash;for this would be on equal terms, but not
  that you should give thy daughter to the Greeks as a chosen victim. Or
  Menelaus, whose affair it was, ought to slay Hermione for her mother's
  sake. But now I, having cherished thy married life, shall be bereaved of
  my child, but she who has sinned, bearing her daughter under her care to
  Sparta, will be blest. As to these things, answer me if I say aught not
  rightly, but if I have spoken well, do not then slay thy child and mine,
  and thou wilt be wise.</p>

  <p>CHOR. Be persuaded, Agamemnon, for 'tis right to join in saving one's
  children. No one of mortals will gainsay this.</p>

  <p>IPH. If, O father, I possessed the eloquence of Orpheus, that I might
  charm by persuasion, so that rocks should follow me, and that I might
  soften whom I would by my words, to this would I have resorted. But now I
  will offer tears as all my skill, for these I can. And, as a suppliant
  bough, I press against thy knees my body, which this [my mother] bore
  thee, [beseeching] that thou slay me not before my time, for sweet it is
  to behold the light, nor do thou compel me to visit the places beneath
  the earth. And I first<a name="IA_87"></a><a
  href="#IAN_87"><sup>[87]</sup></a> hailed thee sire, and thou [didst
  first call] me daughter, and first drawing nigh to thy knees, I gave and
  in turn received sweet tokens of affection. And such, were thy words: "My
  daughter, shall I some time behold thee prospering in a husband's home,
  living and flourishing worthily of me?" And mine in turn ran thus, as I
  hung about thy beard, which now with my hand I embrace: "But how shall I
  [treat] thee? Shall I receive thee when an old man, O father, with the
  hearty reception of my house, repaying thee the careful nurture of my
  youth?" Of such words have remembrance, but thou hast forgotten them, and
  fain wouldst slay me. Do not, [I beseech you] by Pelops and by thy father
  Atreus, and this my mother, who having before brought me forth with
  throes, now suffers this second throe. What have I to do with the
  marriage of Paris and Helen? Whence came he, father, for my destruction?
  Look upon me; give me one look, one kiss, that this memorial of thee at
  least I, dying, may possess, if thou wilt not be persuaded by my words.
  Brother, thou art but a little helpmate to those dear, yet weep with me,
  beseech thy sire that thy sister die not. Even in babes there is wont to
  be some sense of evil. Behold, O father, he silently implores thee. But
  respect my prayer, and have pity on my years. Yea, by thy beard we, two
  dear ones, implore thee; the one is yet a nursling, but the other grown
  up. In one brief saying I will overcome all arguments. This light of
  heaven is sweetest of things for men to behold, but that below is naught;
  and mad is he who seeks to die. To live dishonorably is better than to
  die gloriously.</p>

  <p>CHOR. O wretched Helen, through thee and thy nuptials there is come a
  contest for the Atrides and their children.</p>

  <p>AG. I can understand what merits pity, and what not; and I love my
  children, for [otherwise] I were mad. And dreadful 'tis for me<a
  name="IA_88"></a><a href="#IAN_88"><sup>[88]</sup></a> to dare these
  things, O woman, and dreadful not to do so&mdash;for so I must needs act.
  Thou seest how great is this naval host, and how many are the chieftains
  of brazen arms among the Greeks, to whom there is not a power of arriving
  at the towers of Troy, unless I sacrifice you, as the seer Calchas says,
  nor can we take the renowned plain of Troy. But a certain passion has
  maddened the army of the Greeks, to sail as quickly as possible upon the
  land of the barbarians, and to put a stop to the rapes of Grecian wives.
  And they will slay my daughters at Argos, and you, and me, if I break
  through the commands of the Goddess. It is not Menelaus who has enslaved
  me, O daughter, nor have I followed his device, but Greece, for whom I,
  will or nill, must needs offer thee. And I am inferior on this head. For
  it behooves her, [Helen,] as far as thou, O daughter, art concerned, to
  be free, nor for us, being Greeks, to be plundered perforce of our wives
  by barbarians.</p>

  <p>CLY. O child! O ye stranger women! O wretched me for thy death! Thy
  father flees from thee, giving thee up to Hades.</p>

  <p>IPH. Alas for me! mother, mother. The same song suits both of us on
  account of our fortunes, and no more to me is the light, nor this bright
  beam of the sun. Alas! alas! thou snow-smitten wood of Troy, and
  mountains of Ida, where once on a time Priam exposed a tender infant,
  having separated him from his mother, that he might meet with deadly
  fate, Paris, who was styled Idæan, Idæan [Paris] in the city of the
  Phrygians. Would that the herdsman Paris, who was nurtured in care of
  steers, had ne'er dwelt near the white stream, where are the fountains of
  the Nymphs, and the meadow flourishing with blooming flowers, and roseate
  flowers and hyacinths for Goddesses to cull. Where once on a time came
  Pallas, and artful Venus, and Juno, and Hermes, the messenger of Jove;
  Venus indeed, vaunting herself in charms, and Pallas in the spear, and
  Juno in the royal nuptials of king Jove, [these came] to a hateful
  judgment and strife concerning beauty; but my death, my death, O virgins,
  bearing glory indeed to the Greeks, Diana hath received as first-fruits
  [of the expedition] against Troy.<a name="IA_89"></a><a

  mother, O mother, has departed, leaving me deserted. O hapless me! having

  perish, by the impious slaughter of an impious sire. Would<a

  had never received the poops of the brazen-beaked ships into these ports,
  the fleet destined for Troy, nor that Jove had breathed an adverse wind
  over Euripus, softening one breeze so that some mortals might rejoice in
  their [expanded] sails, but to others a pain, to others difficulty, to
  some to set sail, to others to furl their sails, but to others to tarry.
  In truth the race of mortals is full of troubles, is full of troubles,
  and it necessarily befalls men to find some misfortune. Alas! alas! thou
  daughter of Tyndarus, who hast brought many sufferings, and many griefs
  upon the Greeks.</p>

  vainly wrathful with thy husband, but it is not easy for us to struggle

  friend for his willingness, but it behooves thee also to see that you be
  not an object of reproach to the army, and we profit nothing more, and he
  meet with calamity. But hear me, mother, thinking upon what has entered
  my mind. I have determined to die, and this I would fain do gloriously, I
  mean, by dismissing all ignoble thoughts. Come hither, mother, consider
  with me how well I speak. Greece, the greatest of cities, is now all
  looking upon me, and there rests in me both the passage of the ships and
  the destruction of Troy, and, for the women hereafter, if the barbarians
  do them aught of harm, to allow them no longer to carry them off from
  prosperous Greece, having avenged the destruction of Helen, whom Paris
  bore away.<a name="IA_92"></a><a href="#IAN_92"><sup>[92]</sup></a> All
  these things I dying shall redeem, and my renown, for that I have freed
  Greece, will be blessed. Moreover, it is not right that I should be too
  fond of life; for thou hast brought me forth for the common good of
  Greece, not for thyself only. But shall ten thousand men armed with
  bucklers, and ten thousand, oars in hand, their country being injured,
  dare to do some deed against the foes, and perish on behalf of Greece,
  while my life, being but one, shall hinder all these things? What manner
  of justice is this? Have we a word to answer? And let me come to this
  point: it is not meet that this man should come to strife with all the
  Greeks for the sake of a woman, nor lose his life. And one man, forsooth,
  is better than ten thousand women, that he should behold the light. But
  if Diana hath wished to receive my body, shall I, being mortal, become an
  opponent to the Goddess! But it can not be. I give my body for Greece.
  Sacrifice it, and sack Troy. For this for a long time will be my
  memorial, and this my children, my wedding, and my glory. But it is meet
  that Greeks should rule over barbarians, O mother, but not barbarians
  over Greeks, for the one is slavish, but the others are free.</p>

  account, and thee on account of Greece. For well hast thou spoken this,
  and worthily of the country, for, ceasing to strive with the deity, who
  is more powerful than thou art, thou hast considered what is good and
  useful. But still more does a desire of thy union enter my mind, when I
  look to thy nature, for thou art noble. But consider, for I wish to
  benefit you, and to receive you to my home, and, Thetis be my witness, I
  am grieved if I shall not save you, coming to conflict with the Greeks.
  Consider: death is a terrible ill.</p>

  <p>IPH. I speak these words, no others, with due foresight. Enough is the
  daughter of Tyndarus to have caused contests and slaughter of men through
  her person: but do not thou, O stranger, die in my behalf, nor slay any
  one. But let me preserve Greece, if I am able.</p>

  <p>ACH. O best of spirits, I have naught further to answer thee, since it
  seems thus to thee, for thou hast noble thoughts; for wherefore should
  not one tell the truth? But nevertheless thou mayest perchance repent
  these things. In order, therefore, that thou mayest all that lies in my
  power, I will go and place these my arms near the altar, as I will not
  allow you to die, but hinder it. And thou too wilt perhaps be of my
  opinion, when thou seest the sword nigh to thy neck. I will not allow
  thee to die through thy wild determination, but going with these mine
  arms to the temple of the Goddess, I will await thy presence there.</p>

  <p>MESS. O daughter of Tyndarus, Clytæmnestra, come without the house,
  that thou mayest hear my words.</p>

  <p>CLY. Hearing thy voice, I wretched came hither, terrified and
  astounded with fear, lest thou shouldst be come, bearing some new
  calamity to me in addition to the present one.</p>

  <p>MESS. Concerning thy daughter, then, I wish to tell thee marvelous and
  fearful things.</p>

  <p>CLY. Then delay not, but speak as quickly as possible.</p>

  <p>MESS. But, my dear mistress, thou shalt learn every thing clearly, and
  I will speak from the very commencement, unless my memory, in something
  failing, deceive my tongue. For when we came to the inclosure and flowery
  meads of Diana, the daughter of Jove, where there was an assembly of the
  army of the Greeks, leading thy daughter, the host of the Greeks was
  straightway convened. But when king Agamemnon beheld the girl wending her
  way to the grove for slaughter, he groaned aloud, and turning back his
  head, he shed tears, placing his garments<a name="IA_103"></a><a
  href="#IAN_103"><sup>[103]</sup></a> before his eyes. But she, standing
  near him that begot her, spake thus: "O father, I am here for thee, and I
  willing give my body on behalf of my country, and of the whole land of
  Greece, that, leading it to the altar of the Goddess, they may sacrifice
  it, since this is ordained. And, as far as I am concerned, may ye be
  fortunate, and obtain the gift of victory, and reach your native land.
  Furthermore, let no one of the Greeks lay hands on me, for with a stout
  heart I will present my neck in silence." Thus much she spoke, and every
  one marveled on hearing the courage and valor of the virgin. But
  Talthybius, whose office this was, standing in the midst, proclaimed
  good-omened silence to the people. And the seer Calchas placed in a
  golden canister a sharp knife,<a name="IA_104"></a><a
  href="#IAN_104"><sup>[104]</sup></a> which he had drawn out,&#x2020;
  within its case,&#x2020; and crowned the head of the girl. But the son of
  Peleus ran around the altar of the Goddess, taking the canister and
  lustral waters at the same time. And he said: "O Diana, beast-slaying
  daughter of Jove, that revolvest thy brilliant light by night, receive
  this offering which we bestow on thee, [we] the army of the Greeks, and
  king Agamemnon, the pure blood from a fair virgin's neck; and grant that
  the sail may be without injury to our ships, and that we may take the
  towers of Troy by the spear." But the Atrides and all the army stood
  looking on the ground, and the priest, taking the knife, prayed, and
  viewed her neck, that he might find a place to strike. And no little pity
  entered my mind, and I stood with eyes cast down, but suddenly there was
  a marvel to behold. For every one could clearly perceive the sound of the
  blow, but beheld not the virgin, where on earth she had vanished. But the
  priest exclaimed, and the whole army shouted, beholding an unexpected
  prodigy from some one of the Gods, of which, though seen, they had
  scarcely belief. For a stag lay panting on the ground, of mighty size to
  see and beautiful in appearance, with whose blood the altar of the
  Goddess was abundantly wetted. And upon this Calchas (think with what
  joy!) thus spake: "O leaders of this common host of the Greeks, behold
  this victim which the Goddess hath brought to her altar, a
  mountain-roaming stag. This she prefers greatly to the virgin, lest her
  altar should be denied with generous blood. And she hath willingly
  received this, and grants us a prosperous sail, and attack upon Troy.
  Upon this do every sailor take good courage, and go to his ships, since
  on this day it behooves us, quitting the hollow recesses of Aulis, to
  pass over the Ægean wave." But when the whole victim was reduced to
  ashes, he prayed what was meet, that the army might obtain a passage. And
  Agamemnon sends me to tell thee this, and to say what a fortune he hath
  met with from the Gods, and hath obtained unwaning glory through Greece.
  But I speak, having been present, and witnessing the matter. Thy child
  has evidently flown to the Gods; away then with grief, and cease wrath
  against your husband. But the will of the Gods is unforeseen by mortals,
  and them they love, they save. For this day hath beheld thy daughter
  dying and living [in turn.]</p>

  <p>CHOR. How delighted am I at hearing this from the messenger; but he
  says that thy daughter living abides among the Gods.</p>

  <p>CLY. O daughter, of whom of the Gods art thou the theft? How shall I
  address thee? What shall I say that these words do not offer me a vain
  comfort, that I may cease from my mournful grief on thy account?</p>

  <p>CHOR. And truly king Agamemnon draws hither, having this same story to
  tell thee.</p>

<p class="center">[<i>Enter</i> AGAMEMNON.]</p>

  <p>AG. Lady, as far as thy daughter is concerned, we may be happy, for
  she really possesses a companionship with the Gods. But it behooves thee,
  taking this young child [Orestes,] to go home, for the army is looking
  toward setting sail. And fare thee well, long hence will be my addresses
  to thee from Troy, and may it be well with thee.</p>

  <p>CHOR. Atrides, rejoicing go thou to the land of the Phrygians, and
  rejoicing return, having obtained for me most glorious spoils from
  Troy.</p>

  <p>See Scaliger on Varr. de L.L. vi. p.143, and on Festus s.v.
  Septemtriones. All the editors have overlooked the following passage of
  Apuleius de Deo Socr. p. 42, ed. Elm. "Suspicientes in hoc perfectissimo
  mundi, ut ait Ennius, clypeo," whence, as I have already observed in my
  notes on the passage, there is little doubt that Ennius wrote "in
  altisono mundi clypeo," of which <i>c&#339;li</i> was a gloss, naturally
  introduced by those who were ignorant of the use of <i>mundus</i> in the
  same sense. The same error has taken place in some of the MSS. of Virg.
  Georg. i. 5, 6. Compare the commentators on Pompon. Mela. i. 1, ed.

  bethinks him of removing from his brother's mind the impression produced

  <p>Orestes, coming into Tauri in Scythia, in company with Pylades, had
  been commanded to bear away the image of Diana, after which he was to
  meet with a respite from the avenging Erinnyes of his mother. His sister
  Iphigenia, who had been carried away by Diana from Aulis, when on the
  point of being sacrificed by her father, chances to be expiating a dream
  that led her to suppose Orestes dead, when a herdsman announces to her
  the arrival and detection of two strangers, whom she is bound by her
  office to sacrifice to Diana. On meeting, a mutual discovery takes place,
  and they plot their escape. Iphigenia imposes on the superstitious fears
  of Thoas, and, removing them to the sea-coast, they are on the point of
  making their escape together, when they are surprised, and subsequently
  detained and driven back by stress of weather. Thoas is about to pursue
  them, when Minerva appears, and restrains him from doing so, at the same
  time procuring liberty of return for the Grecian captives who form the
  chorus.</p>

  of [Clytæmnestra,] daughter of Tyndarus, whom my father, as he imagined,
  sacrificed to Diana on account of Helen, near the eddies, which Euripus
  continually whirls to and fro, upturning the dark blue sea with frequent
  blasts, in the famed<a name="IT_2"></a><a

  Agamemnon drew together a Grecian armament of a thousand ships, desiring
  that the Greeks might take the glorious prize of victory over Troy,<a

  outraged nuptials of Helen, for the gratification of Menelaus. But, there
  being great difficulty of sailing,<a name="IT_4"></a><a

  [the consideration of] the omens of burnt sacrifices, and Calchas speaks
  thus. O thou who rulest over this Grecian expedition, Agamemnon, thou
  wilt not lead forth thy ships from the ports of this land, before Diana
  shall receive thy daughter Iphigenia as a victim; for thou didst vow to
  sacrifice to the light-bearing Goddess whatsoever the year should bring
  forth most beautiful. Now your wife Clytæmnestra has brought forth a
  daughter in your house, referring to me the title of the most beautiful,
  whom thou must needs sacrifice. And so, by the arts of Ulysses,<a

  mother under pretense of being wedded to Achilles. But I wretched coming
  to Aulis, being seized and raised aloft above<a name="IT_6"></a><a

  sword; but Diana, giving to the Greeks a stag in my stead, stole me away,

  night hath brought with it, I will tell to the sky,<a name="IT_11"></a><a
  href="#ITN_11"><sup>[11]</sup></a> if indeed this be any remedy. I seemed
  in my sleep, removed from this land, to be dwelling in Argos, and to
  slumber in my virgin chamber, but the surface of the earth [appeared] to
  be shaken with a movement, and I fled, and standing without beheld the
  coping<a name="IT_12"></a><a href="#ITN_12"><sup>[12]</sup></a> of the
  house giving way, and all the roof falling stricken to the ground from
  the high supports. And one pillar alone, as it seemed to me, was left of
  my ancestral house, and from its capital it seemed to stream down yellow
  locks, and to receive a human voice, and I, cherishing this man-slaying
  office which I hold, weeping [began] to besprinkle it, as though about to
  be slain. But I thus interpret my dream. Orestes is dead, whose rites I
  was beginning. For male children are the pillars of the house, and those
  whom my lustral waters<a name="IT_13"></a><a
  href="#ITN_13"><sup>[13]</sup></a> sprinkle die. Nor yet can I connect
  the dream with my friends, for Strophius had no son, when I was to have
  died. Now, therefore, I being present, will to my absent brother offer
  the rites of the dead&mdash;for this I can do&mdash;in company with the
  attendants whom the king gave to me, Grecian women. But from some cause
  they are not yet present. I will go<a name="IT_14"></a><a
  href="#ITN_14"><sup>[14]</sup></a> within the home wherein I dwell, these
  shrines of the Goddess.</p>

  <p>ORESTES. Look out! Watch, lest there be any mortal in the way.</p>

  <p>PYLADES. I am looking out, and keeping watch, turning my eyes every
  where.</p>

  <p>OR. Pylades, does it seem to you that this is the temple of the
  Goddess, whither we have directed our ship through the seas from Argos?<a
  name="IT_15"></a><a href="#ITN_15"><sup>[15]</sup></a></p>

  <p>PYL. It does, Orestes, and must seem the same to thee.</p>

  <p>OR. And the altar where Grecian blood is shed?</p>

  <p>PYL. At least it has its pinnacles tawny with blood.</p>

  <p>OR. And under the pinnacles themselves do you behold the spoils?</p>

  <p>PYL. The spoils, forsooth, of slain strangers.</p>

  <p>OR. But it behooves one, turning one's eye around, to keep a careful
  watch. O Ph&#339;bus, wherefore hast thou again led me into this snare by
  your prophecies, when I had avenged the blood of my father by slaying my
  mother? But by successive<a name="IT_16"></a><a
  href="#ITN_16"><sup>[16]</sup></a> attacks of the Furies was I driven an
  exile, an outcast from the land, and fulfilled many diverse bending
  courses. But coming [to thy oracle] I required of thee how I might arrive
  at an end of the madness that drove me on, and of my toils [which I had
  labored through, wandering over Greece.<a name="IT_17"></a><a
  href="#ITN_17"><sup>[17]</sup></a>] But thou didst answer that I must
  come to the confines of the Tauric territory, where thy sister Diana
  possesses altars, and must take the image of the Goddess, which they here
  say fell from heaven<a name="IT_18"></a><a
  href="#ITN_18"><sup>[18]</sup></a> into these shrines; and that taking it
  either by stratagem or by some stroke of fortune, having gone through the
  risk, I should give it to the land of the Athenians&mdash;but no further
  directions were given&mdash;and that having done this, I should have a
  respite from my toils.<a name="IT_19"></a><a
  href="#ITN_19"><sup>[19]</sup></a> But I am come hither, persuaded by thy
  words, to an unknown and inhospitable land. I ask you, then, Pylades, for
  you are a sharer with me in this toil, what shall we do? For thou
  beholdest the lofty battlements of the walls. Shall we proceed to the
  scaling of the walls? How then should we escape notice<a
  name="IT_20"></a><a href="#ITN_20"><sup>[20]</sup></a> [if we did so?] Or
  shall we open the brass-wrought fastenings of the bolts? of which things
  we know nothing.<a name="IT_21"></a><a href="#ITN_21"><sup>[21]</sup></a>
  But if we are caught opening the gates and contriving an entrance, we
  shall die. But before we die, let us flee to the temple, whither we
  lately sailed.</p>

  <p>PYL. To fly is unendurable, nor are we accustomed [to do so,] and we
  must not make light of the oracle of the God. But quitting the temple,
  let us hide our bodies in the caves, which the dark sea splashes with its
  waters, far away from the city, lest any one beholding the bark, inform
  the rulers, and we be straightway seized by force. But when the eye of
  dim night shall come, we must venture, bring all devices to bear, to
  seize the sculptured image from the temple. But observe the eaves [of the
  roof,<a name="IT_22"></a><a href="#ITN_22"><sup>[22]</sup></a>] where
  there is an empty space between the triglyphs in which you may let
  yourself down. For good men dare encounter toils, but the cowardly are of
  no account any where. We have not indeed come a long distance with our
  oars, so as to return again from the goal.<a name="IT_23"></a><a
  href="#ITN_23"><sup>[23]</sup></a></p>

  <p>OR. But one must follow your advice, for you speak well. We must go
  whithersoever in this land we can conceal our bodies, and lie hid. For
  the [will] of the God will not be the cause of his oracle falling
  useless. We must venture; for no toil has an excuse for young men.<a

  <p>CHOR. But hither comes a herdsman, leaving the sea-coast, about to
  tell thee some new thing.</p>

  <p>HERDSMAN. Daughter of Agamemnon and child of Clytæmnestra, hear thou
  from me a new announcement.</p>

  <p>IPH. And what is there astonishing in the present report?</p>

  <p>HERDS. Two youths are come into this land, to the dark-blue
  Symplegades, fleeing into a ship, a grateful sacrifice and offering to
  Diana. But you can not use too much haste<a name="IT_41"></a><a
  href="#ITN_41"><sup>[41]</sup></a> in making ready the lustral waters and
  the consecrations.</p>

  <p>IPH. Of what country? of what land do the strangers bear the name?</p>

  <p>HERDS. Greeks, this one thing I know, and nothing further.</p>

  <p>IPH. Hast thou not heard the name of the strangers, so as to tell
  it?</p>

  <p>HERDS. One of them was styled Pylades by the other.</p>

  <p>IPH. But what was the name of the yoke-fellow of this stranger?</p>

  <p>HERDS. No one knows this. For we heard it not.</p>

  <p>IPH. But how saw ye them, and chanced to take them?</p>

  <p>HERDS. Upon the furthest breakers of the inhospitable sea.</p>

  <p>IPH. And what had herdsmen to do with the sea?</p>

  <p>HERDS. We came to lave our steers in the dew of the sea.</p>

  <p>IPH. Go back again to this point&mdash;how did ye catch them, and by
  what means, for I would fain know this? For they are come after a long
  season, nor has the altar of the Goddess yet been crimsoned with Grecian
  blood.<a name="IT_42"></a><a href="#ITN_42"><sup>[42]</sup></a></p>

  <p>HERDS. After we woodland herdsmen had brought our cattle down to the
  sea that flows between the Symplegades, there is a certain hollow cave,<a
  name="IT_43"></a><a href="#ITN_43"><sup>[43]</sup></a> broken by the
  frequent lashing of the waves, a retreat for those who hunt for the
  purple fish. Here some herdsman among us beheld two youths, and he
  retired back, piloting his step on tiptoe, and said: See ye not? these
  who sit here are some divine powers. And one of us, being religiously
  given, uplifted his hand, and addressed them, as he beheld: O son of
  Leucothea, guardian of ships, Palæmon our lord, be propitious to us,
  whether indeed ye be the twin sons of Jove (Castor and Pollux) who sit
  upon our shores, or the image of Nereus, who begot the noble chorus of
  the fifty Nereids. But another vain one, bold in his lawlessness, scoffed
  at these prayers, and said that they were shipwrecked<a
  name="IT_44"></a><a href="#ITN_44"><sup>[44]</sup></a> seamen who sat
  upon the cleft through fear of the law, hearing that we here sacrifice
  strangers. And to most of us he seemed to speak well, and [we resolved]
  to hunt for the accustomed victims for the Goddess. But meanwhile one of
  the strangers leaving the rock, stood still, and shook his head up and
  down, and groaned, with his very fingers quaking, wandering with ravings,
  and shouts with voice like that of hunter, "Pylades, dost thou behold
  this? Dost not behold this snake of Hades, how she would fain slay me,
  armed against me with horrid vipers?<a name="IT_45"></a><a
  href="#ITN_45"><sup>[45]</sup></a> And she breathing from beneath her
  garments<a name="IT_46"></a><a href="#ITN_46"><sup>[46]</sup></a> fire
  and slaughter, rows with her wings, bearing my mother in her arms, that
  she may cast upon me this rocky mass. Alas! she will slay me. Whither
  shall I fly?" And one beheld not the same form of countenance, but he
  uttered in turn the bellowings of calves and howls of dogs, which
  imitations [of wild beasts] they say the Furies utter. But we flinching,
  as though about to die, sat mute; and he drawing a sword with his hand,
  rushing among the calves, lion-like, strikes them on the flank with the
  steel, driving it into their sides, fancying that he was thus avenging
  himself on the Fury Goddesses, till that a gory foam was dashed up from
  the sea. Meanwhile, each one of us, as he beheld the herds being slain
  and ravaged, armed himself, and inflating the conch<a name="IT_47"></a><a
  href="#ITN_47"><sup>[47]</sup></a> shells and assembling the
  inhabitants&mdash;for we thought that herdsmen were weak to fight against
  well-trained and youthful strangers. And a large number of us was
  assembled in a short time. But the stranger, released from the attack of
  madness, drops down, with his beard befouled with foam. But when we saw
  him fallen opportunely [for us,] each man did his part, with stones, with
  blows. But the other of the strangers wiped away the foam, and tended his
  mouth, and spread over him the well-woven texture of his garments,
  guarding well the coming wounds, and aiding his friend with tender
  offices. But when the stranger returning to his senses leaped up, he
  perceived that a hostile tempest and present calamity was close upon
  them, and he groaned aloud. But we ceased not hurling rocks, each
  standing in a different place. But then indeed we heard a dread
  exhortation, "Pylades, we shall die, but that we die most gloriously!
  Follow me, drawing thy sword in hand." But when we saw the twain swords
  of the enemy<a name="IT_48"></a><a href="#ITN_48"><sup>[48]</sup></a>
  brandished, in flight we filled the woods about the crag. But if one
  fled, others pressing on pelted them; and if they drove these away, again
  the party who had just yielded aimed at them with rocks. But it was
  incredible, for out of innumerable hands no one succeeded in hitting
  these victims to the Goddess. And we with difficulty, I will not say
  overcome them by force, but taking them in a circle, beat<a
  name="IT_49"></a><a href="#ITN_49"><sup>[49]</sup></a> their swords out
  of their hands with stones, and they dropped their knees to earth
  [overcome] with toil. And we brought them to the king of this land, but
  he, when he beheld them, sent them as quickly as possible to thee for
  lustral waters and sacrifice. But do thou, O virgin, wish that such
  strangers may be here as victims, and if thou slayest these strangers,
  Hellas will atone for thy [intended] murder, paying the penalty of the
  sacrifice at Aulis.<a name="IT_50"></a><a
  href="#ITN_50"><sup>[50]</sup></a></p>

  <p>CHOR. Thou hast told wondrous things concerning him who has appeared,
  whosoever he be that has come to the inhospitable sea from the Grecian
  earth.<a name="IT_51"></a><a href="#ITN_51"><sup>[51]</sup></a></p>

  <p>IPH. Be it so. Do thou go and bring the strangers, but I will take
  care respecting the matters<a name="IT_52"></a><a
  href="#ITN_52"><sup>[52]</sup></a> here. O hapless heart, that once wast
  mild and full of pity toward strangers, awarding the tear to those of
  thine own land, when thou didst receive Grecian men into thine hands.<a
  name="IT_53"></a><a href="#ITN_53"><sup>[53]</sup></a> But now, because
  of the dreams by which I am driven wild, thinking that Orestes no longer
  beholds the sun, ye will find me ill disposed, whoever ye be that come.
  For this is true, I perceive it, my friends,<a name="IT_54"></a><a
  href="#ITN_54"><sup>[54]</sup></a> for the unhappy who themselves fare
  ill have no good feelings toward those more fortunate. But neither has
  any wind sent by Jove ever come [hither,] nor ship, which could have
  brought hither Helen, who destroyed me, and Menelaus, in order that I
  might be avenged on them, placing an Aulis here to the account<a
  name="IT_55"></a><a href="#ITN_55"><sup>[55]</sup></a> of the one there,
  where the sons of Danaus seized, and would have slain me like as a calf,
  and the father who begat me was the priest. Ah me! for I can not forget
  the ills of that time, how oft I stretched out my hands to his beard, and
  hanging on the knees of him who gave me life, spake words like these: "O
  father, basely am I, basely am I wedded at thine hands. But my mother,
  while thou art slaying me, and her Argive ladies are hymning my wedding<a
  name="IT_56"></a><a href="#ITN_56"><sup>[56]</sup></a> with their nuptial
  songs, and all the house resounds with the flute, while I perish by thy
  hands. Hades in truth was Achilles, not the son of Peleus, whom thou
  didst name as my husband, and in the chariot didst pilot me by craft unto
  a bloody wedding." But I, casting mine eye through my slender woven veil,
  neither took up with mine hands my brother who is now dead, nor joined my
  lips to my sister's,<a name="IT_57"></a><a
  href="#ITN_57"><sup>[57]</sup></a> through modesty, as departing to the
  home of Peleus; and many a salutation I deferred, as though about to come
  again to Argos. Oh wretched one, if thou hast died! from what glorious
  state, Orestes, and from how envied a sire's fortune art thou fallen! But
  I reproach the devices of the Goddess, who, if any one work the death of
  a man, or touch with hands a woman newly delivered, or a corpse,
  restrains him from her altars, as deeming him impure, but yet herself
  takes pleasure in man-slaying sacrifices. It can not be that the consort
  of Jove, Latona, hath brought forth so much ignorance. I even disbelieve
  the banquets of Tantalus set before the Gods, [as that they] should be
  pleased with feeding on a boy. But I deem that those in this land, being
  themselves man-slayers, charge the Goddess with their own baseness, for I
  think not that any one of the Gods is bad.</p>

  <p>CHOR. Ye dark blue, dark blue meetings of the sea, which Io, hurried
  along by the brize, once passed through to the Euxine wave, having
  changed the territory of Asia for Europe,&mdash;who were they who left
  fair-watered Eurotas, flourishing in reeds, or the sacred founts of
  Dirce, and came, and came to the inhospitable land, where the daughter of
  Jove bedews her altars and column-girt temples with human blood? Of a
  truth by the surge-dashing oars of fir, worked on both sides, they sailed
  in a nautical carriage o'er the ocean waves, striving in the emulation
  after loved wealth in their houses. For darling hope is in dangers
  insatiate among men, who bear off the weight of riches, wandering in vain
  speculation on the wave and o'er barbarian cities. But to some<a
  name="IT_58"></a><a href="#ITN_58"><sup>[58]</sup></a> there is a mind
  immoderate after riches, to others they come unsought. How did they pass
  through the rocks that run together, the ne'er resting beaches of
  Phineus, [and] the marine shore, running o'er the surge of Amphitrite,<a
  name="IT_59"></a><a href="#ITN_59"><sup>[59]</sup></a>&mdash;where the
  choruses of the fifty daughters of Nereus entwine in the
  dance,&mdash;[although] with breezes that fill the sails, the creaking
  rudders resting at the poop, with southern gales or the breezes of
  Zephyr, to the bird-haunted land, the white beach, the glorious
  race-course of Achilles, near the Euxine Sea. Would that, according to my
  mistress' prayers, Helen, the dear daughter of Leda, might sometime
  chance to come, quitting the city of Troy, that, having been drenched
  about the head with the blood-stained lustral dews, she might die by my
  mistress' hand, paying in turn an equal penalty [for her death.] Most
  joyfully then would we receive this news, if any one came sailing from
  the Grecian land, to make the toils of my hapless slavery to cease. And
  would that in my dreams I might tread<a name="IT_60"></a><a
  href="#ITN_60"><sup>[60]</sup></a> in mine home and ancestral city,
  enjoying the hymns of delight, a joy shared with the prosperous. But
  hither they come, bound as to their two<a name="IT_61"></a><a
  href="#ITN_61"><sup>[61]</sup></a> hands with chains, a new sacrifice for
  the Goddess. Be silent, my friends, for these first-fruits of the Greeks
  approach the temples, nor has the herdsman told a false tale. O reverend
  Goddess, if the city performs these things agreeably to thee, receive the
  sacrifice which, not hallowed among the Greeks, the custom of this place
  presents as a public offering.<a name="IT_62"></a><a
  href="#ITN_62"><sup>[62]</sup></a></p>

  <p>IPH. Be it so. I must first take care that the rites of the Goddess
  are as they should be. Let go the hands of the strangers, that being
  consecrated they may no longer be in bonds. And, going within the temple,
  make ready the things which are necessary and usual on these occasions.
  Alas! Who is the mother who once bore you? And who your father, and your
  sister, if there be any born? Of what a pair of youths deprived will she
  be brotherless! For all the dispensations of the Gods creep into
  obscurity, and no one [absent] knows misfortune,<a name="IT_63"></a><a
  href="#ITN_63"><sup>[63]</sup></a> for fortune leads astray to what is
  hardly known. Whence come ye, O unhappy strangers? After how long a time

  death now near at hand,<a name="IT_66"></a><a
  href="#ITN_66"><sup>[66]</sup></a> when he has no hope of safety, in that
  he joins two ills instead of one, both incurs the charge of folly, and

  <p>IPH. But what hinders thee from granting me this favor?</p>

  <p>OR. I boast renowned Argos for my country.</p>

  <p>IPH. In truth, by the Gods I ask thee, stranger, art thou thence
  born?</p>

  <p>OR. From Mycenæ,<a name="IT_67"></a><a
  href="#ITN_67"><sup>[67]</sup></a> that was once prosperous.</p>

  <p>IPH. And hast thou set out a wanderer from thy country, or by what
  hap?</p>

  <p>OR. I flee in a certain wise unwilling, willingly.</p>

  <p>IPH. Wouldst thou tell me one thing that I wish?</p>

  <p>OR. That something, forsooth,<a name="IT_68"></a><a
  href="#ITN_68"><sup>[68]</sup></a> may be added to my misfortune.</p>

  <p>IPH. And truly thou hast come desired by me, in coming from Argos.</p>

  <p>OR. Not by myself, at all events; but if by thee, do thou enjoy it.<a
  name="IT_69"></a><a href="#ITN_69"><sup>[69]</sup></a></p>

  <p>IPH. Perchance thou knowest Troy, the fame of which is every
  where.</p>

  <p>OR. Ay, would that I never had, not even seeing it in a dream!</p>

  <p>IPH. They say that it is now no more, and has fallen by the spear.</p>

  <p>OR. And so it is, nor have you heard what is not the case.</p>

  <p>IPH. And is Helen come back to the house of Menelaus?</p>

  <p>OR. She is, ay, coming unluckily to one of mine.</p>

  <p>IPH. And where is she? For she has incurred an old debt of evil with
  me also.</p>

  <p>OR. She dwells in Sparta with her former consort.</p>

  <p>IPH. O hateful pest among the Greeks, not to me only!</p>

  <p>OR. I also have received some fruits of her nuptials.</p>

  <p>IPH. And did the return of the Greeks take place, as is reported?</p>

  <p>OR. How dost thou question me, embracing all matters at once!</p>

  <p>IPH. For I wish to obtain this before that thou diest.</p>

  <p>OR. Examine me, since thou hast this longing, and I will speak.</p>

  <p>IPH. Has a certain seer named Calchas returned from Troy?</p>

  <p>OR. He perished, as the story ran, at Mycenæ.</p>

  <p>IPH. O revered Goddess, how well it is! And how fares the son of
  Laertes?</p>

  <p>OR. He has not yet returned to his home, but he is alive, as report
  goes.</p>

  <p>IPH. May he perish, never obtaining a return to his country!</p>

  <p>OR. Invoke nothing&mdash;all his affairs are in a sickly state.</p>

  <p>IPH. But is the son of Thetis, the daughter of Nereus, yet alive?</p>

  <p>OR. He is not. In vain he held his wedding in Aulis.</p>

  <p>IPH. A crafty [wedding] it was, as those who have suffered say.</p>

  <p>OR. Who canst thou be? How well dost ken the affairs of Greece!</p>

  <p>IPH. I am from thence. While yet a child I was undone.</p>

  <p>OR. With reason thou desirest to know the affairs there, O lady.</p>

  <p>IPH. But how [fares] the general, who they say is prosperous.</p>

  <p>OR. Who? For he whom I know is not of the fortunate.</p>

  <p>IPH. A certain king Agamemnon was called the son of Atreus.</p>

  <p>OR. I know not&mdash;cease from these words, O lady.</p>

  <p>IPH. Nay, by the Gods, but speak, that I may be rejoiced, O
  stranger.</p>

  <p>OR. The wretched one is dead, and furthermore hath ruined one.<a
  name="IT_70"></a><a href="#ITN_70"><sup>[70]</sup></a></p>

  <p>IPH. Is dead? By what mishap? O wretched me!</p>

  <p>OR. But why dost mourn this? Was he a relation of thine?</p>

  <p>IPH. I bemoan his former prosperity.</p>

  <p>OR. [Ay, well mayest thou,] for he has fallen, slain shamefully by a
  woman.</p>

  <p>IPH. O all grievous she that slew and he that fell!</p>

  <p>OR. Cease now at least, nor question further.</p>

  <p>IPH. Thus much at least, does the wife of the unhappy man live?</p>

  <p>OR. She is no more. The son she brought forth, he slew her.</p>

  <p>IPH. O house all troubled! with what intent, then?<a
  name="IT_71"></a><a href="#ITN_71"><sup>[71]</sup></a></p>

  <p>OR. Taking satisfaction on her for the death of his father.</p>

  <p>IPH. Alas! how well he executed an evil act of justice.<a
  name="IT_72"></a><a href="#ITN_72"><sup>[72]</sup></a></p>

  <p>OR. But, though just, he hath not good fortune from the Gods.</p>

  <p>IPH. But does Agamemnon leave any other child in his house?</p>

  <p>OR. He has left a single virgin [daughter,] Electra.</p>

  <p>IPH. What! Is there no report of his sacrificed daughter?<a
  name="IT_73"></a><a href="#ITN_73"><sup>[73]</sup></a></p>

  <p>OR. None indeed, save that being dead she beholds not the light.</p>

  <p>IPH. Hapless she, and the father who slew her!</p>

  <p>OR. She perished, a thankless offering<a name="IT_74"></a><a
  href="#ITN_74"><sup>[74]</sup></a> because of a bad woman.</p>

  <p>IPH. But is the son of the deceased father at Argos?</p>

  <p>OR. He, wretched man, is nowhere and every where.</p>

  <p>IPH. Away, vain dreams, ye were then of naught!</p>

  <p>OR. Nor are the Gods who are called wise any less false than winged
  dreams. There is much inconsistency both among the Gods and among
  mortals. But one thing alone is left, when<a name="IT_75"></a><a
  href="#ITN_75"><sup>[75]</sup></a> a man not being foolish, persuaded by
  the words of seers, has perished, as he hath perished in man's
  knowledge.</p>

  <p>CHOR. Alas! alas! But what of us and our fathers? Are they, or are
  they not in being, who can tell?</p>

  <p>IPH. Hear me, for I am come to a certain discourse, meditating what is
  at once profitable for you and me. But that which is well is chiefly
  produced thus, when the same matter pleases all. Would ye be willing, if
  I were to save you, to go to Argos, and bear a message for me to my
  friends there, and carry a letter, which a certain captive wrote, pitying
  me, nor deeming my hand that of a murderess, but that he died through
  custom, as the Goddess sanctioned such things as just? For I had no one
  who would go and bear the news back to Argos, and who, being preserved,
  would send my letters to some one of my friends.<a name="IT_76"></a><a
  href="#ITN_76"><sup>[76]</sup></a> But do thou, for thou art, as thou
  seemest, of no ignoble birth, and knowest Mycenæ and the persons I wish,
  do thou, I say,<a name="IT_77"></a><a href="#ITN_77"><sup>[77]</sup></a>
  be saved, receiving no dishonorable reward, your safety for the sake of
  trifling letters. But let this man, since the city compels it, be a
  sacrifice to the Goddess, apart from thee.</p>

  <p>OR. Well hast thou spoken the rest, save one thing, O stranger lady,
  for 'tis a heavy weight upon me that this man should be slain. For I was
  steersman of the vessel to these ills,<a name="IT_78"></a><a
  href="#ITN_78"><sup>[78]</sup></a> but he is a fellow-sailor because of
  mine own troubles. In no wise then is it right that I should do thee a
  favor to his destruction, and myself escape from ills. But let it be
  thus. Give him the letter, for he will send it to Argos, so as to be well
  for thee, but let him that will slay me. Base is the man, who, casting
  his friends into calamity, himself is saved. But this man is a friend,
  who I fain should see the light no less that myself.</p>

  <p>IPH. O noblest spirit, how art thou sprung from some generous root,
  thou truly a friend to thy friends! Such might he be who is left of my
  brothers! For in good truth, strangers, I am not brotherless, save that I
  behold him not. But since thou willest thus, let us send this man bearing
  the letter, but thou wilt die, and some great desire of this chances to
  possess thee?<a name="IT_79"></a><a
  href="#ITN_79"><sup>[79]</sup></a></p>

  <p>OR. But who will sacrifice me, and dare this dreadful deed?</p>

  <p>IPH. I; for I have this sacrificial duty<a name="IT_80"></a><a
  href="#ITN_80"><sup>[80]</sup></a> from the Goddess.</p>

  <p>OR. Unenviable indeed. O damsel, and unblest.</p>

  <p>IPH. But we lie under necessity, which one must beware.</p>

  <p>OR. Thyself, a female, sacrificing males with the sword?</p>

  <p>IPH. Not so; but I shall lave around thy head with the lustral
  stream.</p>

  <p>OR. But who is the slayer, if I may ask this?</p>

  <p>IPH. Within the house are they whose office is this.</p>

  <p>OR. And what manner of tomb will receive me, when I die?</p>

  <p>IPH. The holy flame within, and the dark chasm of the rock.<a
  name="IT_81"></a><a href="#ITN_81"><sup>[81]</sup></a></p>

  <p>OR. Alas! Would that a sister's hand might lay me out.<a
  name="IT_82"></a><a href="#ITN_82"><sup>[82]</sup></a></p>

  <p>IPH. A vain prayer hast thou uttered, whoever thou art, O stranger,
  for she dwells far from this barbarian land. Nevertheless, since thou art
  an Argive, I will not fail to do thee kindness in what is possible. For
  on thy tomb will I place much adornment, and with the tawny oil will I
  cause thy body to be soon consumed,<a name="IT_83"></a><a
  href="#ITN_83"><sup>[83]</sup></a> and on thy pyre will I pour the
  flower-sucked riches of the swarthy bee. But I will go and fetch the
  letter from the shrines of the Goddess. But do thou not bear ill will
  against me. Guard them, ye servants, [but] without fetters.<a
  name="IT_84"></a><a href="#ITN_84"><sup>[84]</sup></a> Perchance I shall
  send unexpected tidings to some one of my friends at Argos, whom I
  chiefly love, and the letter, telling to him that she lives whom he
  thinks dead, will announce a faithful pleasure.</p>

  <p>CHOR. I deplore thee now destined to the gory streams of the lustral
  waters.<a name="IT_85"></a><a href="#ITN_85"><sup>[85]</sup></a></p>

  <p>OR. 'Tis piteous, truly;<a name="IT_86"></a><a
  href="#ITN_86"><sup>[86]</sup></a> but fare ye well, stranger ladies.</p>

  <p>CHOR. But thee, (<i>to Pylades</i>) O youth, we honor for thy happy
  fortune, that at some time thou wilt return to thy country.</p>

  <p>PYL. Not to be coveted<a name="IT_87"></a><a
  href="#ITN_87"><sup>[87]</sup></a> by friends, when friends are to
  die.</p>

  <p>CHOR. O mournful journeying! Alas! alas! thou art undone. Woe! woe!
  which is the [victim] to be? For still my mind resolves<a
  name="IT_88"></a><a href="#ITN_88"><sup>[88]</sup></a> twain doubtful
  [ills,] whether with groans I shall bemoan thee (<i>to Orestes</i>) or
  thee (<i>to Pylades</i>) first.</p>

  <p>OR. Pylades, hast thou, by the Gods, experienced the same feeling as
  myself?</p>

  <p>PYL. I know not. Thou askest me unable to say.</p>

  <p>OR. Who is this damsel? With what a Grecian spirit she asked us
  concerning the toils in Troy, and the return of the Greeks, and Calchas
  wise in augury, and about Achilles, and how she pitied wretched
  Agamemnon, and asked me of his wife and children. This stranger lady is<a
  name="IT_89"></a><a href="#ITN_89"><sup>[89]</sup></a> some Greek by
  race; for otherwise she never would have been sending a letter and making
  these inquiries, as sharing a common weal in the well-doing of Argos.</p>

  <p>PYL. Thou hast outstripped me a little, but thou outstrippest me in
  saying the same things, save in one respect&mdash;for all, with whom
  there is any communication, know the fate of the king. But I was<a
  name="IT_90"></a><a href="#ITN_90"><sup>[90]</sup></a> considering
  another subject.</p>

  <p>OR. What? laying it down in common, you will better understand.</p>

  <p>PYL. 'Tis base that I should behold the light, while you perish; and,
  having sailed with you, with you I must needs die also. For I shall incur
  the imputation of both cowardice and baseness in Argos and the Phocian
  land with its many dells, and I shall seem to the many, for the many are
  evil, to have arrived alone in safety to mine home, having deserted thee,
  or even to have murdered thee, taking advantage of the sickly state of
  thine house, and to have devised thy fate for the sake of reigning, in
  order that, forsooth, I might wed thy sister as an heiress<a
  name="IT_91"></a><a href="#ITN_91"><sup>[91]</sup></a>. These things,
  then, I dread, and hold in shame, and it shall not be but I will breathe
  my last with thee, be slain, and have my body burned with thee, being a
  friend, and dreading reproach.</p>

  <p>OR. Speak words of better omen. I must needs bear my troubles, but
  when I may [endure] one single trouble, I will not endure twain. For what
  thou callest bitter and reproachful, that is my portion, if I cause thee
  to be slain who hast shared my toils. For, as far as I am concerned, it
  stands not badly with me, faring as I fare at the hands of the Gods, to
  end my life. But thou art prosperous, and hast a home pure, not
  sickening, but I [have] one impious and unhappy. And living thou mayest
  raise children from my sister, whom I gave thee to have<a
  name="IT_92"></a><a href="#ITN_92"><sup>[92]</sup></a> as a wife, and my
  name might exist, nor would my ancestral house be ever blotted out. But
  go, live, and dwell in my father's house; and when thou comest to Greece
  and chivalrous Argos, by thy right hand, I commit to thee this charge.
  Heap up a tomb, and place upon it remembrances of me, and let my sister
  offer tears and her shorn locks upon my sepulchre. And tell how I died by
  an Argive woman's hand, sacrificed as an offering by the altar's side.
  And do thou never desert my sister, seeing my father's connections and
  home bereaved. And fare thee well! for I have found thee best among my
  friends. Oh thou who hast been my fellow-huntsman, my mate! Oh thou who
  hast borne the weight of many of my sorrows! But Ph&#339;bus, prophet
  though he be, has deceived me. For, artfully devising, he has driven me
  as far as possible from Greece, in shame of his former prophecies. To
  whom I, yielding up mine all, and obeying his words, having slain my
  mother, myself perish in turn.</p>

  <p>PYL. Thou shalt have a tomb, and never will I, hapless one, betray thy
  sister's bed, since I shall hold thee more a friend dead than living. But
  the oracle of the God has never yet wronged thee, although thou art
  indeed on the very verge of death. But excessive mischance is very wont,
  is very wont to present changes, when the matter so falls.</p>

  <p>OR. Be silent&mdash;the words of Ph&#339;bus avail me naught, for the
  lady is coming hither without the temple.</p>

  <p>IPH. Depart ye, and go and make ready the things within for those who
  superintend the sacrifice. These, O stranger, are the many-folded
  inclosures of the letter, but hear thou what I further wish. No man is
  the same in trouble, and when he changes from fear into confidence. But I
  fear, lest he having got away from this land, will deem my letter of no
  account, who is about to bear this letter to Argos.<a name="IT_93"></a><a
  href="#ITN_93"><sup>[93]</sup></a></p>

  <p>OR. What wouldst thou? Concerning what art thou disturbed?</p>

  <p>IPH. Let him make me oath that he will ferry these writings to Argos,
  to those friends to whom I wish to send them.</p>

  <p>OR. Wilt thou in turn make the same assertion to him?</p>

  <p>IPH. That I will do, or will not do what thing? say.</p>

  <p>OR. That you will release him from this barbarian land, not dying.</p>

  <p>IPH. Thou sayest justly; for how could he bear the message?</p>

  <p>OR. But will the ruler also grant this?</p>

  <p>IPH. Yea. I will persuade him, and will myself embark him on the
  ship's hull.</p>

  <p>OR. Swear, but do thou commence such oath as is holy.</p>

  <p>IPH. Thou must say "I will give this [letter] to my friends."</p>

  <p>PYL. I will give this letter to thy friends.</p>

  <p>IPH. And I will send thee safe beyond the Cyanean rocks.</p>

  <p>PYL. Whom of the Gods dost thou call to witness of thine oath in these
  words?</p>

  <p>IPH. Diana, in whose temple I hold office.</p>

  <p>PYL. But I [call upon] the king of heaven, hallowed Jove.</p>

  <p>IPH. But if, deserting thine oath, thou shouldst wrong me&mdash;</p>

  <p>PYL. May I not return? But thou, if thou savest me not&mdash;</p>

  <p>IPH. May I never living set footprint in Argos.</p>

  <p>PYL. Hear now then a matter which we have passed by.</p>

  <p>IPH. There will be opportunity hereafter, if matters stand aright.</p>

  <p>PYL. Grant me this one exception. If the vessel suffer any harm, and
  the letter be lost<a name="IT_94"></a><a
  href="#ITN_94"><sup>[94]</sup></a> in the storm, together with the goods,
  and I save my person only, that this mine oath be no longer valid.<a
  name="IT_95"></a><a href="#ITN_95"><sup>[95]</sup></a></p>

  <p>IPH. Knowest thou what I will do?<a name="IT_96"></a><a
  href="#ITN_96"><sup>[96]</sup></a> for the many things contained in the
  folds of the letter bear opportunity for many things.<a
  name="IT_97"></a><a href="#ITN_97"><sup>[97]</sup></a> I will tell you in
  words all that you are to convey to my friends, for this plan is safe. If
  indeed thou preservest the letter, it will itself silently tell the
  things written, but if these letters be lost at sea, saving thy body,
  thou wilt preserve my message.</p>

  <p>PYL. Thou hast spoken well on behalf of the Gods<a name="IT_98"></a><a
  href="#ITN_98"><sup>[98]</sup></a> and of myself. But tell me to whom at
  Argos I must needs bear these epistles, and what hearing from thee, I
  must tell.</p>

  <p>IPH. Bear word to Orestes, the son of Agamemnon, (<i>reading</i>)
  "she<a name="IT_99"></a><a href="#ITN_99"><sup>[99]</sup></a> that was
  sacrificed at Aulis gives this commission, Iphigenia alive, but no longer
  alive as far as those in Argos are concerned."</p>

  <p>OR. But where is she? Does she come back again having died?</p>

  <p>IPH. She, whom you see. Do not confuse me with speaking. (<i>Continues
  reading</i>) "Bear me to Argos, my brother, before I die, remove me from
  this barbarian land and the sacrifices of the Goddess, in which I have
  the office of slaying strangers."</p>

  <p>OR. Pylades, what shall I say? where shall we be found to be?<a
  name="IT_100"></a><a href="#ITN_100"><sup>[100]</sup></a></p>

  <p>IPH. (<i>still reading</i>) "Or I will be a cause of curses upon thine
  house, Orestes," (<i>with great stress upon the name and turning to
  Pylades</i>,) "that thou, twice hearing the name, mayest know it."</p>

  <p>PYL. O Gods!</p>

  <p>IPH. Why callest thou upon the Gods in matters that are mine?</p>

  <p>PYL. 'Tis nothing. Go on. I was wandering to another subject.
  Perchance, inquiring of thee, I shall arrive at things incredible.<a
  name="IT_101"></a><a href="#ITN_101"><sup>[101]</sup></a></p>

  <p>IPH. (<i>continues reading</i>) "Say that the Goddess Diana saved me,
  giving in exchange for me a hind, which my father sacrificed, thinking
  that it was upon me that he laid the sharp sword, and she placed me to
  dwell in this land." This is the burden of my message, these are the
  words written in my letter.</p>

  <p>PYL. O thou who hast secured me in easy oaths, and hast sworn things
  fairest, I will not delay much time, but I will firmly accomplish the
  oath I have sworn. Behold, I bear and deliver to thee a letter, O
  Orestes, from this thy sister.</p>

  <p>OR. I receive it. And letting go the opening of the letter, I will
  first seize a delight not in words (<i>attempts to embrace her</i>). O
  dearest sister mine, in amazement, yet nevertheless embracing thee with a
  doubting arm, I go to a source of delight, hearing things marvelous to
  me.<a name="IT_102"></a><a href="#ITN_102"><sup>[102]</sup></a></p>

  <p>CHOR. Stranger,<a name="IT_103"></a><a

  servant of the Goddess, casting thine arm around her garments that should
  ne'er be touched.</p>

  <p>OR. O fellow-sister born of one sire, Agamemnon, turn not from me,
  possessing a brother whom you never thought to possess.</p>

  <p>IPH. I [possess] thee my brother? Wilt not cease speaking? Both Argos
  and Nauplia are frequented by him.<a name="IT_104"></a><a
  href="#ITN_104"><sup>[104]</sup></a></p>

  <p>OR. Unhappy one! thy brother is not there.</p>

  <p>OR. Ay, to the grandson of Pelops, whence I am sprung.<a

  <p>IPH. What sayest thou? Hast thou any proof of this for me?</p>

  <p>OR. I have. Ask something relative to my ancestral home.</p>

  <p>IPH. Thou must needs then speak, and I learn.</p>

  <p>OR. I will first speak from hearsay from Electra, this.<a

  the strife that took place between Atreus and Thyestes?</p>

  <p>OR. Dost thou then remember weaving [a representation of] this on the
  deftly-wrought web?</p>

  <p>IPH. O dearest one. Thou art turning thy course near to my own
  thoughts.<a name="IT_107"></a><a href="#ITN_107"><sup>[107]</sup></a></p>

  <p>OR. And didst thou receive<a name="IT_108"></a><a

  Aulis?</p>

  <p>IPH. I know it: for the wedding, though good, did not take away my
  recollection.<a name="IT_109"></a><a

  the ancient spear of Pelops in my father's house, which brandishing in

  <p>OR. I will tell you, but these are the beginning for me of many<a
  name="IT_125"></a><a href="#ITN_125"><sup>[125]</sup></a> woes. After
  these evil things concerning my mother, on which I keep silence, had been
  wrought, I was driven an exile by the pursuits of the Erinnyes, when
  Loxias sent my foot<a name="IT_126"></a><a
  href="#ITN_126"><sup>[126]</sup></a> to Athens, that I might render
  satisfaction to the deities that must not be named. For there is a holy

  pollution of his hands.<a name="IT_127"></a><a
  href="#ITN_127"><sup>[127]</sup></a> And coming thither, at first indeed
  no one of the strangers received me willingly, as being abhorred by the
  Gods, but they who had respect to me, afforded me<a name="IT_128"></a><a
  href="#ITN_128"><sup>[128]</sup></a> a stranger's meal at a separate
  table, being under the same house roof, and silently devised in respect
  to me, unaddressed by them, how I might be separated from their banquet<a
  name="IT_129"></a><a href="#ITN_129"><sup>[129]</sup></a> and cup, and,
  having filled up a share of wine in a separate vessel, equal for all,
  they enjoyed themselves. And I did not think fit to rebuke my guests, but
  I grieved in silence, and did not seem to perceive [their conduct,]
  deeply groaning, because I was my mother's slayer.<a name="IT_130"></a><a
  href="#ITN_130"><sup>[130]</sup></a> But I hear that my misfortunes have
  been made a festival at Athens, and that this custom still remains, that
  the people of Pallas honor the Libation Vessel.<a name="IT_131"></a><a

  and stood in judgment, I indeed occupying one seat, but the eldest of the
  Erinnyes the other, having spoken and heard respecting my mother's death,
  Ph&#339;bus saved me by bearing witness, but Pallas counted out for me<a
  name="IT_132"></a><a href="#ITN_132"><sup>[132]</sup></a> the equal votes
  with her hand, and I came off victor in the bloody trial.<a
  name="IT_133"></a><a href="#ITN_133"><sup>[133]</sup></a> As many then as
  sat [in judgment,] persuaded by the sentence, determined to hold their
  dwelling near the court itself.<a name="IT_134"></a><a
  href="#ITN_134"><sup>[134]</sup></a> But as many of the Erinnyes as did
  not yield obedience to the sentence passed, continually kept driving me
  with unsettled wanderings, until I again returned to the holy ground of
  Ph&#339;bus, and lying stretched before the adyts, hungering for food, I
  swore that I would break from life by dying on the spot, unless
  Ph&#339;bus, who had undone, should preserve me. Upon this Ph&#339;bus,
  uttering a voice from the golden tripod, sent me hither to seize the
  heaven-sent image, and place it in the land of Athens. But that safety
  which he marked out for me do thou aid in. For if we can lay hold on the
  image of the Goddess, I both shall cease from my madness, and embarking
  thee in the bark of many oars, I shall settle thee again in Mycenæ. But,
  O beloved one, O sister mine, preserve my ancestral home, and preserve
  me, since all my state and that of the Pelopids is undone, unless we
  seize on the heavenly image of the Goddess.</p>

  <p>CHOR. Some dreadful wrath of the Gods hath burst forth, and leads the
  seed of Tantalus through troubles.<a name="IT_135"></a><a

  thee, and to restore again our sickening ancestral home from troubles, in
  no wise wrath with him who would have slain me. For I should both release
  my hand from thy slaughter, and preserve mine house. But I fear how I
  shall be able to escape the notice of the Goddess and the king, when he
  shall find the stone pedestal bared of the image. And how shall I escape
  death? What account can I give? But if indeed these matters can be
  effected at once, and thou wilt bear away the image, and lead me in the
  fair-pooped ship, the risk will be a glorious one. But separated from
  this I perish, but you, arranging your own affairs, would obtain a
  prosperous return. Yet in no wise will I fly, not even if I needs must
  perish, having preserved thee. In no wise, I say;<a name="IT_136"></a><a
  href="#ITN_136"><sup>[136]</sup></a> for a man who dies from among his
  household is regretted, but a woman is of little account.</p>

  <p>OR. I would not be the murderer both of thee and of my mother. Her
  blood is enough, and being of the same mind with you, [with you] I should
  wish, living or dying, to obtain an equal lot. &#x2020;But I will lead
  thee, even though I myself fall here, to my house, or, remaining with
  thee, will die.<a name="IT_137"></a><a
  href="#ITN_137"><sup>[137]</sup></a>&#x2020; But hear my opinion. If this
  had been disagreeable to Diana, how would Loxias have answered, that I
  should remove the image of the Goddess to the city of Pallas, and behold
  thy face? For, putting all these matters together, I hope to obtain a
  return.</p>

  <p>IPH. How then can it happen that neither you die, and that we obtain
  what we wish? For it is in this respect that our journey homeward is at
  fault, but the will is not wanting.</p>

  <p>OR. Could we possibly destroy the tyrant?</p>

  <p>IPH, Thou tellest a fearful thing, for strangers to slay their
  receivers.</p>

  <p>OR. But if it will preserve thee and me, one must run the risk.</p>

  <p>IPH. I could not&mdash;yet I approve your zeal.</p>

  <p>OR. But what if you were secretly to hide me in this temple?</p>

  <p>IPH. In order, forsooth, that, taking advantage of darkness, we might
  be saved?</p>

  <p>OR. For night is the time for thieves, the light for truth.</p>

  <p>IPH. But within are the sacred keepers,<a name="IT_138"></a><a

  <p>OR. Alas! we are undone. How can we then be saved?</p>

  <p>IPH. I seem to have a certain new device.</p>

  <p>OR. Of what kind? Make me a sharer in your opinion, that I also may
  learn.</p>

  <p>IPH. I will make use of thy ravings as a contrivance.</p>

  <p>OR. Ay, cunning are women to find out tricks.</p>

  <p>IPH. I will say that thou, being slayer of thy mother, art come from
  Argos.</p>

  <p>OR. Make use of my troubles, if you can turn them to account.</p>

  <p>IPH. I will say that it is not lawful to sacrifice thee to the
  Goddess.</p>

  <p>OR. Having what pretext? For I partly suspect.</p>

  <p>IPH. As not being pure, but I will [say that I will]<a
  name="IT_139"></a><a href="#ITN_139"><sup>[139]</sup></a> give what is
  holy to sacrifice.</p>

  <p>OR. How then the more will the image of the Goddess be obtained?</p>

  <p>IPH. I [will say that I] will purify thee in the fountains of the
  sea.</p>

  <p>OR. The statue, in quest of which, we have sailed, is still in the
  temple.</p>

  <p>IPH. And I will say that I must wash that too, as if you had laid
  hands on it.</p>

  <p>OR. Where then is the damp breaker of the sea of which you speak?</p>

  <p>IPH. Where thy ship rides at anchor with rope-bound chains.</p>

  <p>OR. But wilt thou, or some one else, bear the image in their
  hands?</p>

  <p>IPH. I, for it is lawful for me alone to touch it.</p>

  <p>OR. But in what part of this contrivance will our friend Pylades<a
  name="IT_140"></a><a href="#ITN_140"><sup>[140]</sup></a> be placed?</p>

  <p>IPH. He will be said to bear the same pollution of hands as
  thyself.</p>

  <p>OR. And wilt thou do this unknown to, or with the knowledge of the
  king?</p>

  <p>IPH. Having persuaded him by words, for I could not escape notice.</p>

  <p>OR. And truly the well-rowed ship is ready for sailing.<a
  name="IT_141"></a><a href="#ITN_141"><sup>[141]</sup></a></p>

  <p>IPH. You must take care of the rest, that it be well.</p>

  <p>OR. There lacks but one thing, namely, that these women who are
  present preserve our secret. But do thou beseech them, and find words
  that will persuade. A woman in truth has power to move pity. But all the
  rest will perchance fall out well.</p>

  <p>IPH. O dearest women, I look to you, and my affairs rest in you, as to
  whether they turn out well, or be of naught, and I be deprived of my
  country, my dear brother, and dearest sister. And let this first be the
  commencement of my words. We are women, a race well inclined to one
  another, and most safe in keeping secret matters of common interest. Do
  ye keep silence for us, and labor out our escape. Honorable is it for the
  man who possesses a faithful tongue. But behold how one fortune holds the
  three most dear, either a return to our father-land, or to die. But,
  being preserved, that thou also mayest share my fortune, I will restore
  thee safe to Greece. But, by thy right hand, thee, and thee
  [<i>addressing the women of the chorus in succession</i>] I beseech, and
  thee by thy beloved cheek, and thy knees, and those most dear at home,
  mother, and father, and children, to whom there are such.<a

  Who of you will, or will not [speak!] these things.<a

  assent not to my words, I am undone, and my wretched sister.</p>

  <p>CHOR. Be of good cheer, dear mistress, and think only of being saved,
  since on my part all shall be kept secret, the mighty Jove be witness! in
  the things thou enjoinest.</p>

  <p>IPH. May your words profit ye, and may ye be blest. 'Tis thy part now,
  and thine [to the different women] to enter the house, as the ruler of
  this land will straightway come, inquiring concerning the sacrifice of
  the strangers, whether it is over. O revered Goddess, who in the recesses
  of Aulis didst save me from the dire hand of a slaying father, now also
  save me and these, or the voice of Loxias will through thee be no longer
  truthful among mortals. But do thou with good will quit the barbarian
  land for Athens, for it becomes thee not to dwell here, when you can
  possess a blest city.</p>

  <p>CHORUS. Thou bird, that by the rocky cliffs of the sea, halcyon,<a

  Agamemnon, the priestess of the Goddess, and the sheep-slaughtering<a

  wax-bound reed of mountain Pan with Syrinx tune cheer on the oarsmen, and
  prophet Ph&#339;bus, plying the tones of his seven-stringed lyre, with
  song will lead thee prosperously to the rich land of Athens. But leaving
  me here thou wilt travel by the dashing oars. And the halyards by the
  prow,<a name="IT_154"></a><a href="#ITN_154"><sup>[154]</sup></a> will
  stretch forth the sails to the air, above the beak, the sheet lines of
  the swift-journeying ship. Would that I might pass through the glittering
  course, where the fair light of the sun wends its way, and over my own
  chamber might rest from rapidly moving the pinions on my shoulders.<a

  <p>THOAS. Where is the Grecian woman who keeps the gate of this temple?
  Has she yet begun the sacrifice of the strangers, and are the bodies
  burning in the flame within the pure recesses?</p>

  <p>CHOR. Here she is, O king, who will tell thee clearly all.</p>

  <p>TH. Ah! Why art thou removing in your arms this image of the Goddess
  from its seat that may not be disturbed, O daughter of Agamemnon?</p>

  <p>IPH. O king, rest there thy foot in the portico.</p>

  <p>TH. But what new matter is in the house, Iphigenia?</p>

  <p>IPH. O king, no pure offerings hast thou hunted out for me.</p>

  <p>TH. What hath taught you this? or dost thou speak it as matter of

  <p>IPH. That very thing, naught else, for they have done dreadful
  things.</p>

  <p>TH. What, did they slay any of the barbarians upon the shore?</p>

  <p>IPH. They came possessing the stain of domestic murder.</p>

  <p>TH. What? for I am fallen into a longing to learn this.</p>

  <p>IPH. They put an end to a mother's life by conspiring sword.</p>

  <p>TH. Apollo! not even among barbarians would any one have dared
  this.</p>

  <p>IPH. By persecutions they were driven out of all Greece.</p>

  without?</p>

  <p>IPH. Ay, under the holy sky, that I may remove it from blood
  stains.</p>

  <p>TH. But how didst thou discover the pollution of the strangers?</p>

  this.</p>

  <p>TH. So that, forsooth, thou mightest preserve them because of their
  pleasant news!</p>

  Goddess.</p>

  <p>IPH. Ay, because hating all Greece that destroyed me.</p>

  <p>TH. What then shall we do, say, concerning the two strangers?</p>

  <p>IPH. The sea washes out all the ills of men.</p>

  <p>TH. They would certainly fall in a more holy manner before the

  not be told.</p>

  out foul slaughter by slaughter, and the shining light of lamps, and the
  other things, as many as I ordered as purifications for the strangers and
  the Goddess. But I proclaim to the strangers to get out of the way of
  this pollution, if any gate-keeper of the temples keeps pure hands for
  the Gods, or is about to join in nuptial alliance, or is pregnant, flee,
  get out of the way, lest this pollution fall on any. O thou queen, virgin
  daughter of Jove and Latona, if I wash away the blood-pollution from
  these men, and sacrifice where 'tis fitting, thou wilt occupy a pure
  house, and we shall be prosperous. But although I do not speak of the
  rest, I nevertheless signify my meaning to the Gods who know most
  things,<a name="IT_164"></a><a href="#ITN_164"><sup>[164]</sup></a> and

  <p>CHORUS.<a name="IT_165"></a><a href="#ITN_165"><sup>[165]</sup></a> Of
  noble birth is the offspring of Latona, whom once on a time in the
  fruitful valleys of Delos, Ph&#339;bus with his golden locks, skilled on
  the lyre, (and she who rejoices in skill of the bow,) his mother bore
  while yet an infant<a name="IT_166"></a><a

  renowned place of her delivery, destitute of waters,<a

  height haunted by Bacchus, where the ruddy-visaged serpent, with spotted
  back, &#x2020; brazen &#x2020; beneath the shady laurel with its rich
  foliage, an enormous prodigy of the earth, guarded the subterranean
  oracle. Him thou, O Ph&#339;bus, while yet an infant, while yet leaping
  in thy dear mother's arms, didst slay, and entered upon thy divine
  oracles, and thou sittest on the golden tripod, on the throne that is
  ever true, distributing to mortals prophecies from the divine adyts

  Themis, daughter of earth, he expelled her from the divine oracles, earth

  hair, and put an end to the nightly dreams,<a name="IT_172"></a><a

<p class="center">[<i>Enter</i> A MESSENGER.]</p>

  <p>MESS. O ye guardians of the temple and presidents of the altars, where
  in this land has king Thoas gone? Do ye, opening the well-fastened gates,
  call the ruler of this land outside the house.</p>

  <p>CHOR. But what is it, if I may speak when I am not bidden?</p>

  <p>MESS. The two youths have escaped, and are gone by the contrivances of
  Agamemnon's daughter, endeavoring to fly from this land, and taking the
  sacred image in the bosom of a Grecian ship.</p>

  <p>CHOR. Thou tellest an incredible story, but the king of this country,
  whom you wish to see, is gone, having quitted the temple.</p>

  <p>MESS. Whither? For he needs must know what has been done.</p>

  <p>CHOR. We know not. But go thou and pursue him to wheresoever, having
  met with him, thou mayest recount this news.</p>

  <p>MESS. See, how faithless is the female race! and ye are partners in
  what has been done.</p>

  <p>CHOR. Art thou mad? What have we to do with the flight of the
  strangers? Will you not go as quickly as possible to the gates of the
  rulers?</p>

  <p>MESS. Not at least before some distinct informer<a
  name="IT_174"></a><a href="#ITN_174"><sup>[174]</sup></a> tell me this,
  whether the ruler of the land is within or not within. Ho there! Open the
  fastenings, I speak to those within, and tell the master that I am at the
  gates, bearing a weight of evil news.</p>

  <p>THOAS. (<i>coming out</i>) Who makes this noise near the temple of the
  Goddess, hammering at the door, and sending fear within?</p>

  <p>MESS. These women told me falsely, (and tried to drive me from the
  house,) that you were away, while you really were in the house.</p>

  <p>TH. Expecting or hunting after what gain?</p>

  <p>MESS. I will afterward tell of what concerns them, but hear the
  present, immediate matter. The virgin, she that presided over the altars
  here, Iphigenia, has gone out of the land with the strangers, having the
  sacred image of the Goddess; but the expiations were pretended.</p>

  <p>TH. How sayest thou? possessed by what breath of calamity?<a
  name="IT_175"></a><a href="#ITN_175"><sup>[175]</sup></a></p>

  <p>MESS. In order to preserve Orestes, for at this thou wilt marvel.</p>

  <p>TH. What [Orestes]? Him, whom the daughter of Tyndarus bore?</p>

  <p>MESS. Him whom she consecrated to the Goddess at these altars.</p>

  <p>TH. Oh marvel! How can I rightly<a name="IT_176"></a><a
  href="#ITN_176"><sup>[176]</sup></a> call thee by a greater name?</p>

  <p>MESS. Do not turn thine attention to this, but listen to me; and
  having perceived and heard, clearly consider what pursuit will catch the
  strangers.</p>

  <p>TH. Speak, for thou sayest well, for they do not flee by the way of
  the neighboring sea, so as to be able to escape my fleet.</p>

  <p>MESS. When we came to the sea-shore, where the vessel of Orestes was
  anchored in secret, to us indeed, whom thou didst send with her, bearing
  fetters for the strangers, the daughter of Agamemnon made signs that we
  should get far out of the way, as she was about to offer the secret<a
  name="IT_177"></a><a href="#ITN_177"><sup>[177]</sup></a> flame and
  expiation, for which she had come. But she, holding the fetters of the
  strangers in her hands, followed behind them. And these matters were
  suspicious, but they satisfied your attendants, O king. But at length, in
  order forsooth that she might seem to us to be doing something, she
  screamed aloud, and chanted barbarian songs like a sorceress, as if
  washing out the stain of murder. But after we had remained sitting a long
  time, it occurred to us whether the strangers set at liberty might not
  slay her, and take to flight. And through fear lest we might behold what
  was not fitting, we sat in silence, but at length the same words were in
  every body's mouth, that we should go to where they were, although not
  permitted. And upon this we behold the hull of the Grecian ship, [the
  rowing winged with well-fitted oars,<a name="IT_178"></a><a
  href="#ITN_178"><sup>[178]</sup></a>] and fifty sailors holding their
  oars in the tholes, and the youths, freed from their fetters, standing
  [on the shore] astern of the ship.<a name="IT_179"></a><a
  href="#ITN_179"><sup>[179]</sup></a> But some held in the prow with their
  oars, and others from the epotides let down the anchor, and others
  hastily applying the ladders, drew the stern-cables through their hands,
  and giving them to the sea, let them down to the strangers.<a
  name="IT_180"></a><a href="#ITN_180"><sup>[180]</sup></a> But we
  unsparing [of the toil,] when we beheld the crafty stratagem, laid hold
  of the female stranger and of the cables, and tried to drag the rudders
  from the fair-prowed ship from the steerage-place. But words ensued: "On
  what plea do ye take to the sea, stealing from this land the images and
  priestess? Whose son art thou, who thyself, who art carrying this woman
  from the land?" But he replied, "Orestes, her brother, that you may know,
  the son of Agamemnon, I, having taken this my sister, whom I had lost
  from my house, am bearing her off." But naught the less we clung to the
  female stranger, and compelled them by force to follow us to thee, upon
  which arose sad smitings of the cheeks. For they had not arms in their
  hands, nor had we; but fists were sounding against fists, and the arms of
  both the youths at once were aimed against our sides and to the liver, so
  that we at once were exhausted<a name="IT_181"></a><a
  href="#ITN_181"><sup>[181]</sup></a> and worn out in our limbs. But
  stamped with horrid marks we fled to a precipice, some having bloody
  wounds on the head, others in the eyes, and standing on the heights, we
  waged a safer warfare, and pelted stones. But archers, standing on the
  poop, hindered us with their darts, so that we returned back. And
  meanwhile&mdash;for a tremendous wave drove the ship against the land,
  and there was alarm [on board] lest she might dip her sheet-line<a
  name="IT_182"></a><a href="#ITN_182"><sup>[182]</sup></a>&mdash;Orestes,
  taking his sister on his left shoulder, walked into the sea, and leaping
  upon the ladder, placed her within the well-banked ship, and also the
  image of the daughter of Jove, that fell from heaven. And from the middle
  of the ship a voice spake thus, "O mariners of the Grecian ship, seize<a
  name="IT_183"></a><a href="#ITN_183"><sup>[183]</sup></a> on your oars,
  and make white the surge, for we have obtained the things on account of
  which we sailed o'er the Euxine within the Symplegades." But they
  shouting forth a pleasant cry, smote the brine. The ship, as long indeed
  as it was within the port, went on; but, passing the outlet, meeting with
  a strong tide, it was driven back. For a terrible gale coming suddenly,
  drives [the bark winged with well-fitted oars] poop-wise,<a
  name="IT_184"></a><a href="#ITN_184"><sup>[184]</sup></a> but they
  persevered, kicking against the wave, but an ebbing tide brought them
  again aground. But the daughter of Agamemnon stood up and prayed, "O
  daughter of Latona, bring me, thy priestess, safe into Greece from a
  barbarian land, and pardon the stealing away of me. Thou also, O Goddess,
  lovest thy brother, and think thou that I also love my kindred." But the
  sailors shouted a pæan in assent to the prayers of the girl, applying on
  a given signal the point of the shoulders,<a name="IT_185"></a><a
  href="#ITN_185"><sup>[185]</sup></a> bared from their hands, to the oars.
  But more and more the vessel kept nearing the rocks, and one indeed
  leaped into the sea with his feet, and another fastened woven nooses.<a
  name="IT_186"></a><a href="#ITN_186"><sup>[186]</sup></a> And I was
  immediately sent hither to thee, to tell thee, O king, what had happened
  there. But go, taking fetters and halters in your hands, for, unless the
  wave shall become tranquil, there is no hope of safety for the strangers.
  For the ruler of the sea, the revered Neptune, both favorably regards
  Troy, and is at enmity with the Pelopidæ. And he will now, as it seems,
  deliver up to thee and the citizens the son of Agamemnon, to take him
  into your hands, and his sister, who is detected ungratefully forgetting
  the Goddess in respect to the sacrifice at Aulis.<a name="IT_187"></a><a
  href="#ITN_187"><sup>[187]</sup></a></p>

  <p>CHOR. O hapless Iphigenia, with thy brother wilt thou die, again
  coming into the hands of thy masters.</p>

  <p>TH. O all ye citizens of this barbarian land, will ye not, casting
  bridles on your horses, run to the shore, and receive the casting on of
  the Grecian ship? But hastening, by the favor of the Goddess, will ye not
  hunt down the impious men, and some of you haul the swift barks down to
  the sea, that by sea, and by horse-coursings on the land seizing them, we
  may either hurl them down the broken rock, or impale their bodies upon
  stakes. But you women, the accomplices in these plots, I will punish
  hereafter, when I have leisure, but now, having such a present duty, we
  will not remain idle.</p>

<p class="center">[MINERVA <i>appears</i>.]</p>

  <p>MIN. Whither, whither sendest thou this troop to follow [the
  fugitives,] king Thoas? List to the words of me, Minerva. Cease pursuing,
  and stirring on the onset of your host. For by the destined oracles of
  Loxias Orestes came hither, fleeing the wrath of the Erinnyes, and in
  order to conduct his sister's person to Argos, and to bear the sacred
  image into my land, by way of respite from his present troubles. Thus are
  our words for thee, but as to him, Orestes, whom you wish to slay, having
  caught him in a tempest at sea, Neptune has already, for my sake,
  rendered the surface of the sea waveless, piloting him along in the ship.
  But do thou, Orestes, learning my commands, (for thou hearest the voice
  of a Goddess, although not present,) go, taking the image and thy sister.
  And when thou art come to heaven-built Athens, there is a certain sacred
  district in the farthest bounds of Atthis, near the Carystian rock, which
  my people call Al&#339;&mdash;here, having built a temple, do thou
  enshrine the image named after the Tauric land and thy toils, which thou
  hast labored through, wandering over Greece, under the goad of the
  Erinnyes. But mortals hereafter shall celebrate her as the Tauric Goddess
  Diana. And do thou ordain this law, that, when the people celebrate a
  feast in grateful commemoration of thy release from slaughter,<a
  name="IT_188"></a><a href="#ITN_188"><sup>[188]</sup></a> let them apply
  the sword to the neck of a man, and let blood flow on account of the holy
  Goddess, that she may have honor. But, O Iphigenia, thou must needs be
  guardian of the temple of this Goddess at the hallowed ascent of
  Brauron;<a name="IT_189"></a><a href="#ITN_189"><sup>[189]</sup></a>
  where also thou shalt be buried at thy death, and they shall offer to you
  the honor of rich woven vestments, which women, dying in childbed, may
  leave in their houses. But I command thee to let these Grecian women
  depart from the land on account of their disinterested disposition,<a
  name="IT_190"></a><a href="#ITN_190"><sup>[190]</sup></a> I, having saved
  thee also on a former occasion, by determining the equal votes in the
  Field of Mars, Orestes, and that, according to the same law, he should
  conquer, whoever receive equal suffrages. But, O son of Agamemnon, do
  thou remove thy sister from this land, nor be thou angered, Thoas.</p>

  <p>TH. Queen Minerva, whosoever, on hearing the words of the Gods, is
  disobedient, thinks not wisely. But I will not be angry with Orestes, if
  he has carried away the image of the Goddess with him, nor with his
  sister. For what credit is there in contending with the potent Gods? Let
  them depart to thy land with the image of the Goddess, and let them
  prosperously enshrine the effigy. But I will also send these women to
  blest Greece, as thy mandate bids. And I will stop the spear which I
  raised against the strangers, and the oars of the ships, as this seems
  fit to thee, O Goddess.</p>

  <p>MIN. I commend your words, for fate commands both thee and the Gods
  [themselves.] Go, ye breezes, conduct the vessel of Agamemnon's son to
  Athens. And I will journey with you, to guard the hallowed image of my
  sister.</p>

  <p>CHOR. Go ye, happy because of your preserved fortune. But, O Athenian
  Pallas, hallowed among both immortals and mortals, we will do even as
  thou biddest. For I have received a very delightful and unhoped-for voice
  in my hearing. O thou all hallowed Victory, mayest thou possess my life,
  and cease not to crown it.<a name="IT_191"></a><a

<h3>NOTES ON IPHIGENIA IN TAURIS</h3>

<div class="note">
  <p><a name="ITN_1"></a><a href="#IT_1">[1]</a> This verse and part of the
  following are set down among the "oil cruet" verses by Aristophanes, Ran.
  1232. Aristotle, Poet. § xvii. gives a sketch of the plot of the whole
  play, by way of illustrating the general form of tragedy. Hyginus, who
  constantly has Euripides in view, also gives a brief analysis of the
  plot, fab. cxx. For a description of the quadrigæ of Pelops, see
  Philostratus Imagg. i. 19. It must be observed, that Antoninus Liberalis,
  § 27, makes Iphigenia only the supposititious daughter of Agamemnon, but
  really the daughter of Theseus and Helen. See Meurs. on Lycophron, p.
  145.</p>

  <p><a name="ITN_2"></a><a href="#IT_2">[2]</a> I must confess that I can
  not find what should have so much displeased the critics in this word.
  Iphigenia, in using such an epithet, evidently refers to her own intended
  sacrifice, which had rendered the recesses of Aulis a place of no small
  fame.</p>

  hempen baskets, with an open entrance to admit the animal, but which does
  not allow of its egress. This they let down into the sea, the baskets
  being filled with such food as the murex delights in, and, having
  fastened the end of the rope to the rock, they leave it, and returning to
  the place, draw up the baskets full of the fish. Having broken the
  shells, they pound the flesh to form the dye.</p>

  <p><a name="ITN_188"></a><a href="#IT_188">[188]</a> So Hermann rightly

  had intended to use <span lang="el"

  substantively, he would hardly have joined it with <span lang="el"

  ambiguity.</p>

  <p><a name="ITN_189"></a><a href="#IT_189">[189]</a> There is another
  construction, taking <span lang="el" title="klim.
  theas">&#x3BA;&#x3BB;&#x3B9;&#x3BC;. &#x3B8;&#x3B5;&#x3B1;&#x3C2;</span>
  together. On the whole introduction of Minerva, see the clever note of
  the Cambridge editor, p. 158, 159.</p>

  <p><a name="ITN_190"></a><a href="#IT_190">[190]</a> There is evidently a
  lacuna, as the transition to Orestes is worse than abrupt. The
  mythological allusions in the following lines are well explained in the
  notes of Barnes and Seidler.</p>

set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
